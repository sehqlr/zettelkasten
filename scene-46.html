segment zettel-content"><h1>scene-46</h1><div class="pandoc"><p>They were getting high when the conversation just started about the vast universe, and what even is morality, and about the terraforming unit, and how it was so strange that all the spells that were inscribed in the spell circuits are for Earth species exclusively? Why was there only earth grasses, and microbiomes were also mostly Earth species, unless it was proven that a different species was really that much better for them. for the planets that they would be terraforming, right? Also, why did the terraforming sometimes assume that the world had been devastated by war, or some artificial disaster? Surely, you’d want to program in some other contingencies, like if the planet had any existing life in them. Like, any.</p><p>“The base assumption seems to be, that the world is habitable but barren of all life? Or at least mostly? Devastated, I say. Devastated.”</p><p>“But, by what? What would do that sort of thing? Who would? Who would assume planets fit for colonization would be devastated, as you said. Devastated.”</p><p>“That would sorta, imply that there was something making those planets devastated. A devastation engine?”</p><p>“You mean, you actually believe,”</p><p>“Yes, I know what you are thinking, but hear me out,”</p><p>“You honestly think, that this station is the devastation engine. That rumor has been around for as long as the Empire has stood. There is no such thing as as superweapon</p><p>Let’s go again,</p><p>go where?</p><p>Back to that conversation we were having before, when we were talking about the purpose of the station? And you said that there was a conspiracy?</p><p>Sure, if you want to call it that, yes, a conspiracy to commit genocide. Perhaps many times? It’s serious. I know, it’s a serious accusation to make against our government, but hear me out, okay?</p><p>No, I don’t want to talk about this with you because if we get caught, we’ll be in really big trouble, like getting disappeared trouble, got it? I want no part of it.</p><p>You must understand, I think it’s worth the risk</p><p>You must know nothing of risk if you think this is worth it</p><p>I don’t understand what is happening right now</p><p>I think that we are having an argument</p><p>Oh, I suppose that we are.</p><p>Do you want to stop having this discussion? Please, I really don’t want to get into trouble with anyone. I have a family.</p><p>Yes, I am aware of your family, Tobial, you speak of them all the time, really, I insist, I must talk to you about it, you are the main engineer of this project, right? that means something to you. I know it does. What you must understand, is that if I’m right, that you’ll understand that this is strange to say, but that you aren’t the main engineer of this project like you thought? What if, and hear me out, what if There was an array of fire summoning crystals in the core of this ship, and that crystal array was powered by uranium, and that there is no way that anyone would need that much fire, unless they were trying to burn a planet.</p><p>They were trying to talk about the same thing over and over. They keep dodging, until Grynt confesses what he is thinking. Really, what he is thinking, which ends up being right of course. That the ship has two modes, a death mode and a life mode, and when those two were used together, strategically it means that you can completely wipe out an entire planet without completely destroying it. By converting into a devastated planet. That means genocide. That means war crimes. that means trials, and most certainly, hanging. We are not in a good place to deny the truth. If the empire ever gets caught with this thing, we would be exposed and that means accountability.</p><p>Accountability for our actions in intergalactic courts?</p><p>You mean, the space Hague?</p><p>Yes, that. Exactly. Space Hague.</p><p>There was a long pause between the two of them. Tobial seemed to be preoccupied with the space Hague</p><p>space Hague?</p><p>Space Hague. Yes. Yes, yep.</p><p>Then, after that?</p><p>After, you want to know, what comes after? I will tell you what comes after, the space prison, Space-caban. Spazz-caban. How ever you said, say it, you are going to understand what I’m going to tell you, yes. Space prison for space wizards. They drive you mad there, you know?</p><p>Okay, we are in a tough spot here, we need to talk about this, think about my family my family, we are talking here.</p><p>Yes, we are talking about that, yes, we are</p><p>Well, know what, I’m going to be blunt about this.</p><p>Oh really, you want to be blunt about this.</p><p>Yes, I. Do.</p><p>Go ahead then</p><p>Are we having an argument</p><p>Yes, of course we are, you were about to finally tell me the truth.</p><p>To be blunt, this ship and its crew will be committing war crimes if this vessel is ever to be fully built. It may look like a space station, it will eventually have to move from target to its next target. And that makes it a vessel, which means that it has more restrictions on what it can do according to intergalactic law. A space station has a “stand your ground” clause that allows it to defend itself without much ramification. That means that superweapons that stay put are not as threatening. However, if they other side was not aware of the project, then how does treaty apply, really, when you get down to the bones of the matter. The bones of the matter is that this station, this <em>ship</em>, is an engine of devastation, and it must be stopped, and i think that you agree</p><p>Everyone knows how much they were going to get into trouble when they started to do their sabotage. Well, not everyone. If anyone else found out about this, they would be done with then and there. There was too much risk in coordinating their efforts. The were not going to be in the same cell. In fact, this was going to be there last conversation ever. It is going to end in shouting because that is the only way that we are going to get anywhere with this.</p><p>Tobial was always nervous, he was as nervous as when his son was born. Tobial was going to betray his friend to the Empire, because that’s what good citizens to when they are faced with this kind of threat to their lives. That’s what he kept telling himself. He was going to be loyal to his Empire. his countrymen, to humanity being the best species in the galaxy, but yet, there was this persistent feeling that he was going to have to abandon that as a lie, and have to accept that he was going to have to go through with this after all. There was no way that he was going to let this happen, was he? He wasn’t so sure anymore. Hm. He was going to have this think this thing through, and he was going to have to figure out, what exactly it means to betray someone. or something greater than yourself. Is this how all traitors feel? So conflicted? Or was it harder for him because of his level of patriotism. He was going to see fit that no one deserves to go to the space Hague or however you spell it, no one was going to deserve that kind of fate myself? Or that of my family. He loved his family more than the empire, that was for dammed sure. he was going to serve his family above all else. that was the core of his identity. had he not make that clear?</p><p>The walk into the central core of the tower was enough to convince me that my friend was right, and that there was a superweapon being built on a mobile space station, which constitutes is as a vessel, and as such, is subject to the Intergalactic War Accords? The laws that bind us all, human or otherwise.</p><p>The Rebellion must make this mission it’s new priority. That space station, that vessel, must be destroyed. sabotage was attempted and partially successful. We have made the system vulnerable to attack from a squadron of pilots., such as yourselves. we must destroy that station, and soon. The core of the supserweapon also powers their defensive systems, which means that we are going to have a hard time getting close to that station. However, if we boarded that vessel with enough officers, at key locations and times, that will allow us, the ability to defeat the Empire, and exposing them for what they are. For we will broadcast the entire battle to the outside realms. we will show them that we are not going to die without a fight, and not without a cause. We will fight for our right to not become war criminals without our consent. We are here, to save the universe. Any questions?</p></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2021-02-24T15:18"><a href="539743d5.html">Harriet Starr and the Space Conflict</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;fiction/novels&#39;">fiction/novels</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;harriet-starr&#39;">harriet-starr</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.17.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
