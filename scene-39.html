attached segment zettel-content"><h1>scene-39</h1><div class="pandoc"><p>So, I just realized, what does Q’nall want to really do with his life, at least what did he want to do before he became a freedom fighter? I think that he wanted to become a critic, someone who did cultural critique for money. It would be the minimal money for sure, but then again, he could find a patron or crowdfund it, then he’d have been set. He also has a lot of opinions, and I think that’s what causes the initial awkwardness between him and Harriet. Lots of opinions.</p><p>Maybe Q’nall infiltrates the school? Oh, that is probably genius! The plans that need to be delivered to the Rebellion, the space station that has the school is a good place to meet, since it isn’t heavily guarded like the Project Fireball station is. And Tobial could claim that he was evaluating the school for his own children. Q’nall could claim to get a job as a normal worker at the station, and that’s how the information is handed out. Q’nall must then stay at the station and await further instructions. When he gets word that he has to destroy the station, that’s when Harriet gets involved, because she discovers this plot while they are falling in love. Oh jeez, did I just do a Hallmark thing? Is that some kind of spy cliché? I must check, because otherwise there is going to have to be some other way that Harriet gets involved.</p><p>this gives them a chance to meet earlier in the book, and have a romance grow organically, instead of quickly like in a movie. This is a novel, they should have all the time in the world to fall in love. Well, that solves one problem and leads to another. I need to get them to get to the Rebellion, and have Harriet go along with Q’nall at least somewhat willingly.</p><p>So, Q’nall infiltrates the school, what job does he have? The Opinions column of a newspaper, perhaps? Or something more menial, like cleaning stuff. But then again, what are the robots for? They will likely do all the cleanup around the station, and more cheaply too. So there isn’t a hot janitor that Harriet falls for. But I do like the idea of a opinion column, since that is their whole deal at first. She starts to write in to that jerk in the newspaper. But then again, what kind of newspaper does she read? Maybe the opinions that Q’nall have are for football? No, he writes one and that starts the feud. Yeah, that’s how it all starts, a “bad opinion” starts off their romance.</p><p>Okay, so Q’nall is posing as a newspaper person, and Harriet is a student. Is the newspaper a student paper, or a station paper? I think it’s not going to be like the Daily Prophet, I think this is a station only paper, like South 40 News. Hyperlocal insight into the station where we all live, or something like that. Something where a forged identity can be accepted, an official bribed. Maybe the newspaper is supportive of the rebellion, at least in secret. Yeah, that’s it, the newspaper has been supplying coded messages to the rebellion for months now, and they are willing to smuggle Q’nall onto the station and accept him as an employee. They are an independent institution after all, they can make up their own rules. It’s been getting worse and worse under this Empress, but at least there is still freedom of the press.</p><p>And, Q’nall doesn’t disguise his name? Nah, that’s not good enough. Q’nall goes by the alias of Roberto, which is a human name. But then again, a lot of aliens adopt human sounding names if they want to blend in more. Show that they are willing to assimilate, which is always a question being asked by an hegemony during these times. That’s the Empire, for those of you that didn’t understand what I was saying. Q’nall goes by Roberto, but reveals his real name to Harriet on purpose, even though he knows it could get him into trouble. That’s the first act of trust between the two of them, and that is really nice isn’t it? I think it is. I think I’m going to have to add all the romantic bits here and there, in order to make things interesting. OK, so when he tells her his name, he tells her to call him Nall, since that’s his last name in this alias, and that is what most of his friends call him anyway. This was a common tactic in the Rebellion, since false names are hard to forge, it helps if some of the same characters are used in the new chip. At least, that’s what Q’nall was led to believe. That’s what the programmer Chi’day said.</p><p>Oh great, I’m going to have to come up with Rebellion characters too.Oh boy, lots of character building, not like I haven’t ever done that before. It might be nice to make them up in the style of a Fate character, so that I can practice making characters that way too. Including stunts and stuff. But definitely high concept and trouble.</p><p>OK, so we know that Q’nall is disguised as a newspaper person, what is the paper called? Also, would it be a paper, or would be a local holonews outlet? Like their job is to import in official newscasts, and then add in their own stuff? Like how Canada does it? where they have local stuff mandated into the TV world? I’ve always admired that about them. Anyway, I think that the local holonews does everything via holovid, obviously, so Q’nall actually has his face in vlogs about his opinion on stuff. It’s never controversial opinions, at least, not to anyone paying little attention. One thing is for sure, that Q’nall never makes a purple-faced tirade about how bad the rebellion is. No one at that local holovid news outlet does. There’s enough of it in the official transmissions, they say, they want to balance this stuff.</p><p>WAIT A FINGER LICKING MINUTE. Q’nall isn’t in the rebellion to begin with, he’s just a sympathizer! Then, he meets up with Eenee and the others when they join the Rebellion. All the scenes with Rebellion fighters are just going to have to go in the sequel?</p></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2021-02-24T23:01"><a href="c954b8e6.html">Harriet Starr and the Space Conflict</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2021-02-24T15:18"><a href="539743d5.html">Harriet Starr and the Space Conflict</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;harriet-starr&#39;">harriet-starr</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;scene&#39;">scene</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.17.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
