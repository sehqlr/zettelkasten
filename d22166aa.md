The solubriousness of that word was just incredible, said Nelly not
knowing what the word even meant. It’s almost as if words have no
meaning!

Sorry, I’m a bit drunk and writing/fragment things down as I think them. We don’t
ususally go to fancy dinner parties, especially not the Sandersons’.
It’s just that “multitudediousness” is not a “solubriuos” word.

It’s a twenty dollar word

She said, oh, well excuse me for trying to be fancy! And you should
drink less.

\[oh man, I need to start listening to people again\]
