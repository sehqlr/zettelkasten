and the Fiction of Custom</p><p>“Habit is habit, and not to be flung out the window by any man, but coaxed downstairs a step at a time.” –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s Calendar</p><p>The excuse “It’s force of habit” is used by those who do the same thing repeatedly; this excuse is even more useful if the activity be embarrassing or debilitating. This line of reasoning, and others like it, form a type of rationale that purpeturate a situation, even when using the excuse itself. There are such things as good habits and bad habits, and they have a massive effect on daily life. And just as Pudd’nhead Wilson’s Calendar states, habit cannot be “flung out the window”– if one digs a rut, one must climb out of their own power.</p><p>In Mark Twain’s novel <em>Pudd’nhead Wilson</em>, force of habit is more than an a personal struggle—it’s socially binding. Cultural habit forms a person’s ascribed status, and continues that status until the masses are proved otherwise. The title character, David Wilson, works for years to convince the townsfolk of Dawson’s Landing that he isn’t the “Pudd’nhead” they claimed when they didn’t understand his witty comments about half-dogs. Roxana, fair-skinned slave of the Driscolls’, switches babies in the crib and forever changes their fates– the son called “Chambers” becomes an illiterate slave, and “Tom” becomes a rich white property owner. For them, ascribed status and personal and cultural habit form a strong foundation and hinderance to their lives and personal development.</p><p>At the beginning of the novel, David Wilson arrives in Dawson’t Landing, and, unfamiliar with the mind-set of the townsfolk, makes an “unfortunate remark” about owning half a dog (59). In a secretive street caucus, they determined his social fate:</p><p>Mr. Wilson stood elected. The incident was told all over the town, and gravely discussed by everybody. Within a week he had lost his first name; Pudd’nhead took it’s place. In time he came to be liked, and well liked too; but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on, and it stayed. That first day’s verdict made him a fool, and he was not able to get it set aside, or even modified […] it held its place, and was to continue to hold its place for twenty long years. (60)</p><p>The result of this half-dog incident is perpetuated by social habit of Dawson’t Landing for twenty years. No one will do business with him, and the only mention of sustained social interaction he has with anyone is with Judge Driscoll and the Society of Freethinkers, they being the only members. However, with all of this extra free time, Wilson manages to keep up certain personal habits of his own that benefit him by the end of the novel. His interests in fingerprinting and palmistry, his upkeep with the law, even his Calendar, all serve him at the end in apprehending the murderous Tom Driscoll, and earn him the mayorship of Dawson’t Landing society, leaving behind the title of Pudd’nhead forever.</p><p>Just as Wilson’s given name, the social situation of Dawson’s Landing is ridgedly reenforced through cultural habit. The people that live in the town are divided into a three-caste system: at the lowest level are the slaves, such as Roxana and Chambers; in the middle class are the ordinary people of the town, like Pudd’nhead Wilson; and finally, the First Families of Virginia, the sociopolitical elite and practitioners of the code of honor. These F.F.V. families, such as the Driscolls, the Howards, and the Essexes, uphold a very conservative aristrocratic view, imported from “the Old Dominion.” (141) The two principal players in the story that belong to this caste are Judge Driscoll and Pembroke Howard. They have an ascribed status that they embrace:</p><p>In their eyes it was a nobility. It had its unwritten laws, and they were as clearly defined and as strict as any that could be found among the printed statutes of the land. The F.F.V. Was born a gentleman; his highest duty in life was to watch over that great inheritance and keep it unsmirched. (139)</p><p>The code of the gentleman is very important to Judge Driscoll. When he is informed that Tom settled with Count Luigi in a court of law, instead of dueling with him in the field of honor, Driscoll reacts as if “has received a death-stroke” (140). When Driscoll confronts Tom about the incident, he challenges Tom’s cowardly ways, “You cur! You scum! You vermin! Do you mean to tell me that blood of my race has suffered a blow and crawled to a court of law about it?” (141) However, these strict notions of blood are mixed up long before this all happens, because both Tom and Chambers are raised in the “wrong” caste, among the “wrong” blood.</p><p>The initial distinction between Tom and Chambers is entirely fabricated, or at the very least, relies entirely on fabric. When Wilson first encounters the two nearly identical infants side by side, he comments, “How can you tell them apart, Roxy, when they haven’t any clothes on?” (65). During her death-toilet episode, Roxana realizes that she can’t tell them apart without the distinction of clothing. Roxana places the rags upon ‘free’ Tom and places riches upon ‘slave’ Chambers, and when the two are sitting side by side, she utters, “Now who would b’lieve clo’es could do de like o’ dat? Dog my cats if it ain’t all <em>I</em> kin do to tell t’ other fum which, let alone his pappy” (71). In this revelation of hers, she realizes they cannot be easily recognized apart from the clothing they wear. Because clothing is used as a status symbol (the pearls indicate wealth in abundance) as soon as her biological son dons the rich clothing, in Roxana’s mind and anyone that isn’t aware of the switch, he becomes Thomas à Beckett, heir of the Driscoll estate. The other is redesignated to become Valet de Chambers, house slave. Although they are different biologically, and have Wilson’s fingerprint records to prove it, society can only easily identify surfacial details, like cut of dress.</p><p>At this point, Roxana decides to make the switch permanent, to save her son from being sold “down the river.” She begins to practice calling her own child “Marse Tom” and the other “Chambers”, treating her new “master” with privilege and her “own child” with harshness:</p><p>As she progressed with her practice, she was surprised to see how steadily and surely the awe which had kept her tongue reverent and her manner humble toward her young master was transferring itself to her speech and manner toward the usurper, and how similarly handy she was becoming in transferring her motherly curtness of speech and peremptoriness of manner to the unlucky heir of the ancient house of Driscoll. (73)</p><p>Roxana, through the power of habit, easily transfers her love and respect to her son, rather than to her master’s child. With other tricks, such as smearing their faces with jam and such, she convinces the townsfolk and the Driscolls as well. From that point onward, the ascribed status of the two babies formulate what environment they shall grow up in. Unlike Wilson, these children aren’t fully formed or educated to understand what has happened to them. Only when they are older than twenty years is the truth revealed by the trial at the end of the novel.</p><p>The trial of Judge Driscoll’s murder at the conclusion of <em>Pudd’nhead Wilson</em> serves as the end of the ascribed statuses of Wilson, Chambers, and Tom, for better or for worse. Through his presentation of evidence with showmanship, Wilson proves that the true identity of Tom and Chambers, proves that Tom irrevocably killed Judge Driscoll, and disproves that he is a “pudd’nhead.” The citizens of Dawson’s Landing are fully impressed by his performance, and as they exit the courtroom, they “shout themselves hoarse over ever sentence that fell from his lips” and declare, “And this is the man the likes of us have called a pudd’nhead for more than twenty years. He has resigned from that position, friends […] but it isn’t vacant – we’re elected” (224). With this public performance only does he wrest the townsfolk’s respect. Another “beneficiary” of the trial was Chambers, who moved up the ranks with a fingerprint. Looking purely at social movement, Chambers is increadibly fortunate; however, Chambers has lived his whole life as a slave, and the habit will not be coaxed up the social stair very easily. “His gait, his attitudes, his gestures, his bearing, his laugh – all were vulgar and uncouth” It will take a great feat of personal effort for Chambers to become Thomas à Beckett, heir of the Driscoll estate. The “usurper” Tom, on the other end of the trial’s proceedings, has an immediate status change, from a spoiled gentleman’s son to a criminal slave. Ironically, this saves him from being incarcerated or lynched; however, he does end up being “sold down the river” (226).</p><p>Through the opinions and rumors embraced by everyone in Dawson’s Landing, from someone as esteemed as Judge Driscoll to someone as lowly as Roxana, ascribed status and cultural habit have a strong effect upon everyone’s lives.A misplaced wittism can cost you income for twenty years, a switch of cradles and clothes can make a man or slave, an insult in the street can result in a duel. The ascribed status of a person can become the foundation for their entire identity, and, as the novel demonstrates, it can be a serious hinderance to people as well. But there is hope for them, as shown by Wilson’s “Scotch patience and pluck” (61). Through fingerprinting and careful, hard work, anyone can move themselves anywhere within the ranks within twenty years. And after the change, their lives, however long or short, easy or hard it is afterwards, will settle down into a mode of daily behavior– after all, it’s force of habit.</p></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link"><a href="113a7ff2.html">Creative Writing Index</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;age/university&#39;">age/university</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;essay&#39;">essay</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;homework&#39;">homework</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.17.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
