# Man In A Masoleum

I stroll the sepulchers  
Unconscious causation culled —  
Which, unwittingly wandering  
I entered the entrapment  
Of melancholy mausoleum

Foot falls of failure  
And surer shortcomings  
Echo upon empty halls,  
The sound pursues the subtle spaces  
And undulates the underground.

I wander with wonder  
Through the throne room  
Of Death and Decay;  
My intrinsic introspection  
Considering the cadavers:

Lost, listless, limp  
These threadbare things  
Of various virtue and vices  
During the daylight does  
Instigate imagined imagery…

Perished persons impart  
No knowledge natural  
Friendly or fine from  
Absence of acquaintance  
Yet, I yearn the yarn!

What wanderlust  
Did these deceased  
Take? Tirades too  
Incredible to enunciate?  
Curiosity kills!

Woebegone wilderness?  
Happy Home?  
Amiable Adventure?  
Traitorous Tide?  
?! (What?)

Now: naïve announcements  
Asking the unaskable  
Echo upon empty halls  
The sound pursues the subtle spaces  
And undulates the underground.

Mute is the muse  
For answer absent  
Pitch points — projecting  
Innumerable nothings  
To quench my quandary

Ready rashness rages  
Against agnostic answer —  
Damnation! Damnation  
Upon unknowable  
— My mind remonstrates

…Still, still stillness  
Grim graves regressing  
Towards towering tombs;  
The mausoleum’s multitudes  
Staging silent stand,

Cold corpses cry out  
Gasping guttural gusts  
Of verbalizations, then vanishing!  
For phantasms forsaking,  
Uplifting relief I’m alive!

Alive, and alone.  
Sickness sweeping my soul  
Rapid realization rearing —  
I, incandescent island in  
Desolate darkness.

Doth I did design  
Shaping from shadows  
Gloomy gravestone, engraved  
With scrawl and scrap, self-  
Known nomenclature;

Such a sight to see!  
Faint familiar face  
Buried, embedded  
Seeped in sad stone  
Endless night endures!

Trapped in tomb  
No one may notice  
A hark of help  
From failed faculties:  
Nay, night endures!

Visceral visions provokes  
Piteous ponderings; upon  
Unforgivable future  
And unrequited release  
Of inevitable End.

Calmly, I consider  
Perfect permanency  
Many mausoleum make;  
Further, even if foul  
Ruin rampant— *remains*!

Then, peculiar portrait  
Envisioning: entrapped by  
Self-sepulcher, see  
Newer knaves enter  
My mausoleum!

They wonder as they wander  
Through the throne room  
Of Death and Decay;  
Their mighty musings  
Considering my cadaver:

They smile and sigh  
Regarding, reading  
Elegant engravings;  
“Here Lies Love Lost—  
Taken Too Untimely.”

Why, what whimsy!  
Silly to suppose simple  
Caption to capture!  
Inscribe my Experience?  
Inane impossibility!

Looking at lookers  
Having heavens’ hatred  
I note these knaves; not  
Strangers I see…several  
Mirror images of me?

Inconsiderate counterfeits!  
Starkly, straightly staring  
At earnest entombment;  
Gawk, guffaw, and regress  
To thankless thinking!

Tumultuous torture  
To receive refutation—  
If, unbound from buriaI,  
‘twould take the time  
To tell the tale!

Lifetime lasting, a lengthy  
Discourse on my days  
(Such a story necessitates  
An entire epic to encompass),  
Revealing my Reality.

Unfeeling, the facsimiles  
Yawned at the yarn!  
Indifferently desirous  
For freedom— fleeing for  
More entertaining environs.

Alone again, amidst  
Shades of shadows.  
Vivid vision of  
My Tale, a tapestry  
Unraveled, unwoven!

Surrounded by silence,  
Nothing nourishing nothing;  
My mummified mouth makes  
Cloud of cold condensation  
Form; frail life to follow.

Death doth not deal  
Judgment, nor Justice,  
Nor Punishment, nor Place;  
Loneliness of life looms  
Upon paltry perishing.

My memories make  
Impressions of intimacy;  
Multitudes of multitudes  
Of fine friends, freeing  
My soul of sorrows.

Simply, the smiling  
Truth triumphantly tells:  
The day you doth  
Adjourn the journey  
Loneliness…*Illusion*!
