# Enigma

All four of them were in the fenced in city playground, waiting. What
for, they did not know, for they all had been lead here by some same
force, and insidious darkness that was watching them from afar.

“So, what do we do now?” Vernon asked. His palms were already sweaty. He
didn’t feel comfortable at all since they took his protective gloves
away.

“We do as we were told: wait.” Norma repeated what the mysterious tape
recorder had said earlier. And so they waited for a little while longer.

Vernon paced a little more, now attempting to writhe his hands free of
the darkness he sensed in them.

“Finally.” All four of them jumped at the vocalization. Spinning around,
they intended to locate the source of the disturbance, however, they
quickly gave up, resigning to quiet panic.

Out of the darkness came a figure. Not even when looked closely upon did
Norma, Vernon, Greg, or Dr. Fredrick recognize any hint of familiarity.
We all know him, of course, as Rodger Perkins.
