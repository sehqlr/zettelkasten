“We don’t want to have the aliens live in our worlds anymore!” The
Empress Augusta Regalus Victoria declared. “We want them out of our
worlds and they should stay out. Our Empire is for the human species,
and not for anyone else. It is humans that have built this empire from
their blood and bones, and we can keep their memory pure by keeping the
aliens out. They are a kind of bad thing that I don’t want around any
more. And to make an example of them, to show you exactly what I mean, I
shall kill and execute this alien who you all know as Autok of Khell. He
has been found guilty of sedition and of cheating in zero-g football, he
was definitely cheating because we made up a rule that says that he has
biological enhancements that he’s not allowed to have because he is an
alien. There is no way that anyone could think that he didn’t do
anything wrong because that’s what I say, and what I say goes and I
really hope that you all will vote for me in the coming election.
Because somehow I wrote in Trumpese, not regal emperessness. So there. I
have fun everyone, I have fun.”
