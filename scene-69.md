I have a lot of thoughts on how long this book should be. I keep
thinking about sequels too, but that doesn’t make any sense to think
about at this current moment. What I need to think about is how I’m
going to tie all of these loose ends together into a cogent story. I
have no idea how I’m going to do that, but it’ll likely involve index
cards with scene names on them. Or maybe headlines in a markdown
document that I can rearrange. We’ll see. Anyway, I need to get going
with the plot, or something. I have no idea what I should be writing
about next, but I know for a fact that it should be something
interesting. Or something boring, actually. I have no clue what to do
and it’s pretty early on in the month, I have a feeling that I should be
doing more reading of fanfic or of romance, because I know that those
scenes exist but I need to write them. I’m still undecided if there are
going to be any romance scenes in the final cut, but I need words and
those are the only ideas that I have. The other thing is that I could
start describing events in excruciating detail. Ooo, or I could start
writing out pointless dialog for the characters, to get a feel for how
they are? That’s actually a pretty good idea for when I’m writing high,
that’s not what’s happening right now.
