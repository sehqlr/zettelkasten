it now all comes down to the plan that Tobial came up with. It seemed like a pretty good plan, but what bothered Harriet about the plan was that involved her flying in a spaceship. It seems that the Rebellion was in need of warm bodies for their battle fleets, and although it was promised to her that she was not going to be involved in a dogfight, she was still really certain that she wasn’t going to come out of this whole adventure without seeing some blaster fire. Just saying. There was a pretty good chance that she wasn’t going to come out of this alive, or not in jail, or whatever happens to rebels when they are caught. She was certain that she was going to go to political prison at this point. Then again, she accepted that when she accepted to come here. These were the consequences of her choice, and although it was a hard choice to make, she decided that she was going to follow through with it. She was pretty good at follow through, except when there was homework involved. Then she needed more help, but hey, you can’t be good at everything. At least that’s what his smart friends always said.</p><p>The plan was something brilliant, I’m sure. It has to do with switching the station from combustion mode to terraforming mode while the combustion spell chamber is powering up. With all the spell energy building up in the chamber with no where for it to go, it’ll leave the chamber the only way it can, by exploding. And with that amount of energy being released, it’s probably going to be a really big explosion. Possibly enough to destroy the entire station. All of Project Fireball will go up in a fireball. The real trick is to leave the station before it explodes but after the sabotage. There was going to be about a 15 minute window max, Tobial said, from when the switch takes place to when the chamber will go critical. But we can’t just make the switch then leave, someone might switch it back, so we have to do the switch, then damage the equipment, then leave. The reason why Harriet was going to need to be on a ship is because they needed to be able to get two and from the station without being noticed. Luckily, the Rebellion bought a shuttle, the same kind of shuttle that the Empire uses, and then Tobial used his Imperial knowledge to program the shuttle to behave like one that was purchased by the Empire. That way, it should be able to pass as a friendly ship onto the station, at least enough for it to get past the shields, so that they could apparate in and out of there before they all die. However, of course, if they did die during the mission, it will have been worth it because it will stop the Empire from creating a superweapon, that will devastate worlds and conquer them for the Empire.</p><p>I can make that plan work in the fiction, otherwise, I’ll change it, but it seems like a decent plan considering the magic and technology. Since people can teleport themselves from place to place, why not use that for the infiltration? And there’s a detail in my head that I don’t think I’ve written anywhere: Unlike portkeys and other pieces of magitech that does teleporting, when someone uses their own powers to teleport, it cannot be redirected, so you have to set up different spells to counteract people being able to teleport in and out of places. Fortunately for the Rebellion, because the station is a high-trust project, there aren’t any personal teleportation prevention spells active in the project, since that would slow down production if people couldn’t apparate from place to place on the station. Well, that was going to cost them the battle, because Tobial knows the station pretty intimately, they are going to apparate in to a well hidden junction, and then crawl to the manual switch that they need to through to switch the station from combustion to terraforming. The mode control switch, I guess it’ll be called. That switch is going to take some time to throw, and when it does, it’s going to set off some alarms, so there’s going to be a fight once that process is started. The plan for getting the switch to stay in place is to do something fancy, but what ends up happening is that they have to melt the metal in place and thus freeze the control to the terraforming position. If the station doesn’t get destroyed, that would low them down enough to not destroy the fleet around the station long enough for them to escape with their lives.</p><hr /><p>The jig is up, someone shouted. That wasn’t good. Something was supposed to happen when they activated the thing, but they didn’t expect someone to catch them. And they weren’t expecting them to say that.</p><p>Tobial, is that you? Are you betraying your Empress? how could you, you broke your oath!</p><p>You must understand, Gerrund, that I had to do this, I cannot stand by and allow my family to live in an empire where I helped build a genocide machine. I will not allow it</p><p>What do you mean, genocide? This is a terraforming station</p><p>It’s not just a terraforming station, Gerrund, it is a death station. The central tower’s core is filled with fire summoning crystals that burn a planet to ashes. Then the terraforming function is activated, and that’s when the station brings life to a planet; after it has already been destroyed. I cannot abide by that, Gerrund, I cannot. I do this for my own family, so that they are not a part of this.</p><p>your family are going to suffer because of you, Tobial! They will go to prison for being your family, and they will be interrogated for a long time. They were victims in this situation; your victims. I cannot stand by and let this sabotage happen. I’m going to arrest you in the name of the Empress.</p><p>We don’t have time for this, Q’nall said, as he cast his spell. The enemy officer Gerrund froze up like a plank, and fell over. Sorry about that, Q’nall said, but we have got to get out of here. Did he activate any alarms before I got him?</p><p>No, we are fine in that regard. That was a lapse in judgment, actually. Standard procedure dictates that you shouldn’t monologue before you sound the alarm.</p><p>They started to run towards their meeting point with the rest of the group. As it turns out, you have to activate the manual override for the station mode in three places, and so they had to split up to get the job done in time. They were meeting in the place that they apparated in, by the cargo bay filled with plant life. The kind of plant life that you need on a station with an arboretum. Most stations of this design have at least one park within them, because many sentient species, but especially humans, need green spaces in order to feel good about their living spaces. In fact, one of the best jobs on a space station is gardener or groundskeeper, since you get to visit many different places of the ship, and you even get to make friends and visit their quarters during your shift and take care of their plants. However, most people take care of their own plants, but there are a few that insist on having a gardener do it. That’s not always all they do either; on space stations, women don’t have affairs with milkmen, they have affairs with gardeners. Or so I’m told, it’s not like I’d know anything about that directly.</p><p>So, they all meet up in their place, but not before attracting attention from the armada officers on patrol in the station.</p><hr /><p>The deed was done. They were able to melt the lever for the manual override, and that should keep that in the locked open position for a while. The others didn’t melt there’s, but nothing can ever go entirely to plan. Real life just gets in the way of it.</p><p>When they meet up at the rendezvous, Harriet couldn’t melt hers, so she just took the whole lever, and used it as a club to fight off people. It’s unorthodox, but she was alive, wasn’t she?</p><hr /><p>I think that I want to talk about the possible sex scene in this story. I’m not sure if it’s going to be included in the final cut, or even in any cut of the story, but I know that in the story, there is room for a sex scene. Probably right before their mission against the Project Fireball station. That’s when they would have time to do anything romantic.</p><p>Now, I need to have a lot of imagination and research to be able to write a sex scene at all, let alone one that takes place between a human and an alien. I’m just not sure if I can could do that, even without the added wrinkle that both of them are trans and unsure of their bodies. I mean, Q’nall only transitioned relatively recently, and Harriet hasn’t had any surgeries as far as I’m concerned, although that may change based on what my readers say makes sense. Because, if you lived in a magical world, would you transition surgically as soon as possible if it were a direct procedure? I have no idea. That’s the kind of question that makes me uncomfortable. I could guess, but knowing me, I’d guess wrong and be really offensive. But I don’t want to be offensive, I want to be a positive influence on the world. So, I’m not going to write those scenes until I have more of an idea of how it should go.</p><p>Then again, this is a Harry Potter Star Wars work, which means that there could be no room for a sex scene, depending on how much I want that to influence me. I could make this more of a young adult story, in which case that the romance can be limited to nothing really that explicit to match with my source material and make it easier for my younger readers. I want to be able to have some of my family members read it, and I think a sex scene would be out of the question for some of them, but then again, honestly the whole trans thing might be too much for certain members of my family, and so they won’t be reading this story.</p><p>The real question is, who is my audience? Can I get readers from that audience to read this work? I have no clue, but I’ll let future me worry about that. But I should be worrying about audience a little bit, right? Since I’m writing something for an audience, presumably? I mean, I’m not just writing this for myself, of I’d be writing an entirely different story, one without these tricky questions about trans rights and sexuality and stuff like that, because traditionally I don’t really worry about that sort of thing. In fact, there’s only one story that I can think of that even mentions sex, and that was in passing.</p><p>So, what should I do? I think that I’m going to not worry about writing the scene, or even thinking about the scene, until later, when I can do some more research into how those pieces are written, so I can learn how to do it. Otherwise, I’m just guessing at what is exciting and that’s not the way to go with this sort of thing at all.</p><hr /><p>When we get home, we have a lot to talk about, Jem said to Harriet after their adventure. Harriet, as mentioned somewhere else in the manuscript, goes to live with Jem and family after the adventure is over, and thus ends their careers in the Rebellion. Or so they think. Actually, that doesn’t make any sense, wouldn’t there be consequences for joining the Rebellion, and Harriet would have to face those consequences, right? But I really like the idea of Harriet living with Jem and family. Maybe that’s how we can start the story, with Harriet living with them and struggling with trying to figure out how to live her life after school. I mean, she’s set of becoming a footballer, but she’s unsure that she’ll make that work, so she struggles with having a backup plan. Plus, football is really competitive, so that’s another thing. Actually, I’m thinking too much about other people. Harriet is sure about everything at the start of the story! Duh. So she starts out with certainty, has a bunch of doubt in the middle, then ends up with a different kind of certainly at the end. So that’s how that’s going to work, not ending their adventures at home, rather ending their adventure with the Rebellion. Yeah, that’s the way to go. Plus, Harriet is going to be out of school anyway, so there’s no point in having her end up spending the summer there, since there will be no school next year.</p><p>Anyway, what was I writing about? Oh right, the start of the story. I think that the story will start with Jem and family spending time with Harriet, and some opening dialog will establish their personalities. Harriet’s family definitely was killed by some kind of military accident, but instead of it happening on Project Fireball, it happens somewhere else, like during a battle or something. Harriet’s parents and her were aboard a ship when enemy fire disabled that ship and caused an abandon ship order to happen.</p><hr /><p>So, that’s how the story begins, but how does it end? With Harriet standing on the observation deck of a ship staring at a milky way galaxy? I don’t think I’ll be that much of a thief. I think that I’ll have the ending be with Harriet and Q’nall looking into each other’s eyes. That seems right to me. And holding hands. In the rebel encampment. Under the stars, yeah, that’s how I’ll get that reference in, they will be under the stars planetside, lying down in the grass looking up. That sounds really nice actually, so that’s what I’ll do.</p><hr /><p>I wonder if I could bother you for just a moment, the man said to the other man. He was holding a giant hydrospanner.</p><p>What do you need? The man started to star at the hydrospanner. Didn’t we establish earlier in the manuscript that wands are the primary tool in this universe? Why do we need a hydrospanner? What even is a hydrospanner anyway?</p><p>No clue, I was written that way, the man said, promptly ending the scene in shame.</p><p>Hey, listen, not all spontaneous scenes are any good. Don’t blame me, blame the brain that I carry around in my head. And my typing fingers, that allowed that to happen. I mean, what the hell fingers? Where were you?</p><p>Anyway, so I was talking about the beginning and the end of the story, where does Q’nall enter into it? I know that he is with the Rebellion pretty much the whole time that he’s in the main story, but what about his family, about his past? I’m going to have to spend some time thinking about that, but since I’m so close to winning I’m not really sure if I want to pants it or to plan it, after writing more about other things and coming back to the manuscript to see what I’ve said about Q’nall already. That I’ve just forgotten, you know? 50k words is a lot of words, and I’ve forgotten some things that I’ve already written about. Maybe this is why people try to plan this out? To reduce the number of mistakes that you make? Reduce the inconsistencies? It’s entirely possible. Then again, I really like the panting approaching because I’m able to not plan and see what happens and be surprised by the results. That’s something that I really enjoy, seeing a random process produce something interesting to see or read. I think that’s why I’m really interested in generative art. And I think next time that I’m going to try to do generative art, I’m going to look at a lot of examples first before I try to make something, so that I can have a starting point, kind of like this novel. I had two starting points that I was drawing inspiration from, and this is the best year I’ve ever had with writing. I think in my life, really. I feel really confident in my work even though I don’t have outside validation yet, and that is huge for me. I really value other people’s opinion, not my own typically. I am going to try to carry this momentum to other parts of my life, and live to be a better person to myself.</p><p>enough about me, aren’t you hear to read about something else. Namely someone else? Harriet Starr is the star of the show, and I want to make everyone like her the way that I end up liking her, with her transition from bratty know it all to a rebellion member. That’s pretty much Luke and Harry’s journey, isn’t it?</p><hr /><p>Space magic is something that I’d like to talk about now. I wonder what all the implications are that I could explore with space magic. I know that I really shouldn’t try to explain everything, since that would be trying to take the magic out of the magic, so that’s going to be a priority. I cannot explain everything in excruciating detail because that will take away from the magic of it. I need to keep some things entirely mysterious. But then again, they are in a school, where they learn about magic, and that is something that I need to keep in mind too. I have to have a universe that is consistent, or it falls apart in critique. I need to have this stuff on lockdown, as it were. I think that I will discover the right mix of mystery and explanation later on in revisions.</p><hr /><p>What is Harriet’s favorite coffee drink? I think black coffee without anything in it, because she’s like that, and she will choke down a bad coffee without complaining because coffee isn’t supposed to be any good. When it comes to tea though, Harriet prefers something more Delicious than that. I want to say peppermint, but that’s too close to the real person that Harriet is being modeled after. Instead, I want to have her like something like cardamom tea or something like that something floral. That’s her drink of choice, and of course water. They have water in the future still, right?</p><p>Does she drink alcohol? Actually, only tastes of it, she doesn’t want to poison her body with alcohol that much. This is an irrational belief that she has held onto from young childhood and refuses to let go, even though it is completely ridiculous and illogical, but that’s our Harriet. Just something about everything that she needs to have an opinion on.</p><p>Speaking of trying, should the romance between Harriet and Q’nall be really awkward at first, or should it be like really good for them the whole time. IF they are trigger each other’s Intuition about each other, then there doesn’t have to be an awkward period, does there? Eh, there should be, that’s pretty common in these kinds of stories, and that other approach just seems to pollyannaish to me. So, there will be awkwardness. But how does it happen? I want to know what dating experiences are like for trans folks. I want to have my other desk up here, this is ridiculous, I want to have a proper desk to work at, and my desk downstairs is no long a proper desk. Well, it is a proper desk, but not a proper work station, because of all the crap that is in there. I want to make sure that there is a desk down there for anyone who needs that desk, so I’m going to swap the desks. This desk can go downstairs with that bad chair, and that desk can come up here to live with me. And I’ll have the desktop computer just headless and running web services, and its going to be great, you wait and see.</p><hr /><p>I’m going to win, I’m going to win, I’m going to win, I’m going to win, I’m going to win, Harriet kept saying to herself while she was prepping for the big game. I wonder if the visiting team is nice, she thought to herself. It’s not like there’s really anyone who understands football like her mates, but it’s interesting to think about the other team. I mean, they were people, after all. Not necessarily human, she had to remnd herself, because anyone able bodied can play football. Actually, there is a special league for people who aren’t ablebodied that magitech can’t fix, so anyone can play football. It is the best sport. All other sports are just filler for football. She didn’t have to ask anyone that she just knew down in her soul. She knew that football was the right thing for her life, and there wasn’t going to be anything else that comes into her life that will change that. There wasn’t going to be some kind of political thing that happens, or a boy. Gross. Boys were gross at her school. People seem to think that they solved nasty boys but she wasn’t convinced that was in fact accurate. She was still bothered by some of the more desperate ones, and that was enough to make her swear off boys forever. She really wished that she were into girls. That would make life so much easier. And that’s the end of that line of thinking, time to think about winning. That was the best part of football, winning. I mean, sportsmanship! Hey, that word is sexist, what’s a gender neutral version of that word? I have no idea, we’ll edit it in post.</p><p>My arms are getting tired from typing for long periods of time because I have to keep them suspended above the keyboard. Maybe this is something that I need to do as a typist and just develop those muscles. We’ll see what happens, but I’m going to need frequent breaks until I get the better desk up here. That will be priority tomorrow. If I win tonight, which I intend to do, I’m going to slow down on writing and make sure that I’m comfortable while doing it, because I plan on doing much more of it moving forward. I think that I want more tea, my stomach is upset and that ginger in the spiced chai was helping. I think that I’m going to want to start eating ginger candy or something if my stomach is going to be upset all the time.
