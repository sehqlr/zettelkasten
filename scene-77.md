I wonder if I could bother you for just a moment, the man said to the
other man. He was holding a giant hydrospanner.

What do you need? The man started to star at the hydrospanner. Didn't we
establish earlier in the manuscript that wands are the primary tool in
this universe? Why do we need a hydrospanner? What even is a
hydrospanner anyway?

No clue, I was written that way, the man said, promptly ending the scene
in shame.

Hey, listen, not all spontaneous scenes are any good. Don't blame me,
blame the brain that I carry around in my head. And my typing fingers,
that allowed that to happen. I mean, what the hell fingers? Where were
you?
