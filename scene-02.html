out of there, Q’nall and Eenee rapidly floated to the enemy ship’s position and opened fire. The first few volleys were unsuccessful, they completely missed the target because the enemy ship moved out of the way of the blasts of magical energy.</p><p>“Damn, there goes our surprise, Nall,” Eenee shouted into her radio transmitter, “Looks like we are going to have to destroy this ship. We can’t jeopardize the mission, you know that.”</p><p>“We might be able to disable them still, just keep them from apparating out of here. You keep taking the shots, I’ll cover you.” Q’nall began to reactivate his ships systems to get ready for a dog fight. He flipped toggles in the proper sequence. Normally this kind of thing is a preflight check that you take slowly so your ship doesn’t get destroyed in the vacuum of space by a systems failure. The fact that he was doing this while also trying to take down a fighter would have gotten a talking to from his commanding officer for sure.</p><p>His engines fully charged, he began attack pattern upsilon, a pretty rare maneuver that involved flying in a chaotic pattern that is meant to throw the enemy off balance, but requires a great deal of balance itself.</p><p>“Careful Nall, your ship is getting too close, I might hit you,” Eenee’s voice came over the comm system, the radio that operates at greater than the speed of light, it operates at the speed of magic.</p><p>“Take the shot!” Q’nall shouted into his radio, “Don’t worry about me!” Q’nall was still swaying his ship back and forth, getting closer and closer to his target. The Imperial fighter wasn’t having much luck evading his attack pattern, but Q’nall was determined to capture the enemy and take them prisoner. He knew that the ship would have to divert power to the apparation drive to be able to jump out of normal space, and based on the intelligence reports they’ve stolen, these Imperial ships have to be nearly at a standstill in order to activate the drive. Because he was closing in on them, the enemy couldn’t apparate.</p><p>Unless.</p><p>The enemy ship started to glow. The light became more and more bright, more and more powerful. The enemy ship was still dodging both the magical blasts from Eenee and the buzzing annoyance of Q’nall, but the apparation drive was clearly activating. Not in the way that it normally operates, but it was clearly… overloading? Q’nall couldn’t believe it, were they going to self-destruct? No, that didn’t make sense.</p><p>Unless, they were diverting all their weapon power into the drive. That explains the glowing energy field, it looks exactly like when a weapon system is about the explode. But in this case, if they were skilled enough, they might be able to regulate the power flow and be able to activate the spell circuitry when the apparation core was charged enough. But it looks like the drive is overloading and could explode. If that drive isn’t activated soon, the enemy pilot, Eenee, and Q’nall would all die.</p><p>“I’m closing in, Nall, I can’t get a good shot,” Eenee shouted over the comm system, “Keep on their tail, I’m the cavalry.”</p><p>“No!” Q’nall was desperate enough to pull the radio transmitter closer to his face, “We’ll be destroyed–”</p><p>There was a flash of light, and all three ships disappeared from normal space.</p><hr /><p>Harriet Starr was working on a potion. For Alchemistry IV, naturally. There was no way that she was going to get top marks for this job. It was green, but it was supposed to be more of a teal color. Why does she need to know how to make potions anyway? This whole recipe was a complete joke anyway. Brewing the leaves of the Trekalian tea bush with ginger and bowels of frog is really supposed to be a way to cure the common cold? Shouldn’t this be part of basic medical training, not part of normal school? When would she need this? She wasn’t planning on getting sick.</p><p>She looked at the instructions again. Oh! She turned up the temperature on the burner another notch. The mixture became turquoise. She looked at the ebook again. The florid writing was preserved from the original text from over 400 years ago. Right around the time that Trekalia was first discovered. Research mages be researching maging, she guessed. She tapped on the ebook device with her sonic wand. The page turned into a turquoise color when she did so, which looked exactly like her mixture was now. Did she discover a new potion, or was this ebook rubbish. She decided to take the ebook and shake it up a bit. The same color change came to the picture of the potion on the page. Rubbish. But at least she was going to get better marks on this mixture.</p><p>“Professor Wickflit, this ebook is rubbish, I mean, broken slightly. The color’s all wrong.”</p><p>Professor Wickflit looked up from examining another student’s microcauldron. “Ah, Miss Starr, let me take a look.” They came over to Harriet’s desk. “Ah, I see you got the color right! Nice work, Miss Starr.”</p><p>“The book told me the wrong color. I had to shake it to get it to display right. The magic is off.”</p><p>“Well, we’ll put this in the bin for the Magitech department, and we’ll see that it doesn’t get fixed,” the professor smiled their little smile. “Meanwhile, did you turn it off and on again? I know that’s what the tech folk are going to say.” The professor then proceeded to laugh their little laugh. Not much of a laugh, more of a chortle. “Well, now, let’s take a look at yours, Mister Baker.”</p><p>Using honorifics was an old affectation for Professor Wickflit. Normally Wickflit was the Classics Professor, but they were filling in for Professor Riish, who was the Alchemistry professor most of the time. At the beginning of the class, Wickflit said that Riish was out due to having a bad cold.</p><p>Wait a moment, Harriet thought to herself. Wasn’t today’s class all about the cure for the cold? And Riish was an Alchemistry expert, shouldn’t she be able to cure herself? What the hell was up with that? Maybe she could ask the Professor about it after the bell chimed.</p><p>Meanwhile, the potion she was working on started to bubble. She turned the heat off and started to prepare the potion for bottling, which was the standard procedure for these kinds of experiments. There was a secondary mark for how well your potion holds up on the shelf for a standard month. She hoped that her doesn’t get moldy again. That was embarrassing, and the mold started to have a personality and everything. She was going to name it Albert. It was a sad day when she had to destroy her son.</p><p>Before she knew it, the bell was chiming. It was incessantly cheerful, she always thought. Oh good job, kids, you made it through drudgery, now you can walk through these hallways you’ve sadly memorized to your next assignment, your next class, your next test. Senioritis should have a cure in a bottle, because Harriet Starr had a really bad case of senioritis.</p><p>She approached Professor Wickflit. “Professor, excuse me please, but you said that Professor Riish had a cold?”</p><p>“Why yes, she does. The most common of colds I’m afraid.”</p><p>“Well, wasn’t our assignment the cure for the cold? Couldn’t she, you know, have brewed some up herself? I’m sorry to ask but I really like her and I want her to be well.”</p><p>“Isn’t that nice?” Professor Wickflit patted her shoulder. “It turns out that her people don’t have the same blood as we do, which means that the cure isn’t going to work. Sorry to give you such bad news.”</p><p>“That’s alright, Professor, thanks for explaining it to me,” Harriet bit her lip, “How long will she be out?”</p><p>“Oh, it’s no telling what happens when aliens get our diseases. She might be out for a few days, or she may be out much, much longer.”</p><p>Harriet noticed a change in Wickflit’s face. They seemed, well, preoccupied with some other thoughts.</p><p>“Are you going to keep teaching us Alchemistry, Professor?”</p><p>“I shouldn’t think so,” the Professor said, with a slightly glazed look on his face, “I’m sure a substitute will be here shortly. They are usually pretty good with the subs these days. Back in my day, we had to wait a week for a good substitute to show up. We got into such trouble then.” They smiled. “Now, run along now, Miss Starr, there’s a good girl.”</p><p>Harriet readjusted her pack and started to walk out the door, turned to ask the Professor another question, then thought better of it. She had to go to her voice lessons, and Professor Xann didn’t like it when she was late.</p><hr /><p>When Q’nall came to, he was on the ground. Not in his ship, not in space, but on the ground. What ground? What? How?</p><p>He heard a groaning. It was Eenee. Just a few paces away. She was bleeding from her nose. Q’nall put his fingers on his lips and pulled it away. Yep, green, pasty fluid. That was his alright. He looked around. Yes! The enemy pilot was a little always off, still passed out. Or dead. He started to get up, but his knee gave out. He looked down. The artificial knee that he got two years ago wasn’t warm like it was supposed to be. He caressed it with his hand. Yep, cold. That means that the magic failed, and that he wasn’t going to be walking under his own power any time soon. He didn’t have the skills to do these repairs. He looked at his exposed kneecap. There was just the smallest protrusion of metal from it. He placed his thumb over the metal. Cold. Damn. He was going to need a magitechnition on this one.</p><p>He dragged himself over to Eenee. “Hey, hey, wake up, don’t go dying on me.”</p><p>Eenee wasn’t looking too good. She had a black eye. That was a pretty common injury for pilots that flew the Veesta-class fighters. The helmets had a partial heads up display embedded over the pilot’s stronger eye to allow for information to be displayed to the pilot regardless of head direction. It was the kind of thing that seems good on paper but not good in practice. Unfortunately, it was a hard hack to remove the module from the helmet every time you flew, so a lot of pilots just turn the heads up display off except for emergency sigils. You don’t want to deactivate emergency sigils, unless you want your commanding officer to be royally pissed at you. Or if you want to die. Or both.</p><p>“Eenee, wake up, you have a HUD eye,” Q’nall starting to ready a slap, then Eenee raised her hand and lightly grabbed his wrist.</p><p>“Why aren’t we dead?” Eenee grumbled, “How are we planet-side, we were no where near a planet.”</p><p>“The explosion, that must be it” Q’nall said, “The apparation spell must have activated, in like, the explosion. We were all caught in it, and we must have, apparated… here.”</p><p>“Where is here?” Eenee mumbled.</p><p>“I have no clue. I’ve never heard of anything like this happening,” Q’nall started to look around, surveying the landscape. It was pretty nice, actually. Probably the nicest planet he’d ever been on. He looked at the sky. It was a brilliant blue. He clutched a clump of ground, looking at the small, tightly gripping grass and the topsoil. “I think here is an Imperial planet.”</p><p>“How do you know that?” Eenee was starting to pull her self up from the ground.</p><p>“I’ve never seen grass like this. It must be genetically engineered. And the sky is really, really clear. That means that this planet has been terraformed, or at least maintained like a park. That must mean that this is an Imperial planet that is really, really established.”</p><p>“I think you are just complaining about our usual haunts.” Eenee started to stand now. “I think you are jealous. Now let’s stop worrying about the grass and focus on our prisoner?”</p><p>“I’m not sure if we aren’t the prisoners now.” Q’nall said anxiously. “If this is an Imperial planet, we are doomed to be prisoners ourselves, and I don’t know about you, but I’m not going to be stuck in an Imperial camp.”</p><p>“Are you kidding? If we are on Imperial soil, we’ve invaded. That means that we get executed. Plus this is a hostage situation now.”</p><p>“Since when?”</p><p>“Since we have a hostage,” Eenee smiled. “We can’t get home without our ship’s apparation drive, so now we are going to have to negotiate a way off this planet, and that enemy,” she said, pointing a bloody finger at the prone fighter pilot, “is our hostage.”</p><hr /><p>Tobial wasn’t really going to do this, was he? Well, he was the main magitech engineer on this station. This death station. He shouldn’t call it that. This was Project Fireball, not Project Death Station. Tobial was a nervous man, by nature, so this was probably just nerves getting to him again. He was the main engineer dammit, not a philosopher. He had a job to do. And this weapon was going to end the war, wasn’t it? Well, he shouldn’t call it a war. War was never formally declared by the emperor. This was a civil action, or whatever they called it these days. Peace-making effort? Tobial shook his head.</p><p>He was really going to do it. He was going to install the final piece to the weapon in a matter of weeks now. Before, it was months ago. Years ago. Tobial walked to the computer terminal in his quarters and flipped it on. The magic sigils danced to life on the screen, until they got into place and then shows the standard starting screen. Tobial always imagined that the sigils had a life of their own, and that they were greeting each other as they traveled across the flat surface of the terminal glass. The teletype keyboard awaited his entry. Tobial hesitated, naturally, but then he entered his commands, swiftly typing out the sigils on the keyboard. The screen changed again, the little symbols waltzing to their new positions.</p><p>It had been 8 years, 4 months, and 26 days since the start of Project Fireball. The original projections had this project done in under five years, but that was an optimistic projection. But then again, you always gave the Emperor an optimistic projection. She wasn’t one to like bad news. Her ruling council figured that one out years ago, after about half of them were put in prison for pessimistic projections that exasperated her. Because the Emperor was the law, she was above it, which means that her displeasure was the cause for any number of imprisonments. There was no death penalty in the Empire, but imprisonment was common. Usually what happened was that you’d get charged for conspiracy and sedition, then she would pardon you six months later, as a warning.</p><p>Maybe that’s what’s been keeping him from action all this time. Tobial was a careful man, his family depended on him. If something happened, if he was caught doing any more sabotage, he was going to get his family imprisoned, and he couldn’t bear that. His sweet husband and three daughters don’t deserve to be imprisoned, even if his children were going to be put into a school rather than prison. It was the same, in his mind. They would certainly think so. It was amazing what triplets would think, when they thought together. They were going to that school, right? The space station school, what was it called now? Oh yes, the Unity Institute. They had a rather good zero-g football team, as he recalled.</p><p>He entered in new commands, and the screen danced to life again. This time, one sigil grew and expanded until it was a perfect line drawing of Project Fireball. Half of it was a bog standard space station, with a circular design and a central spike down the middle. Rather like a pretzel stick through a donut, if the donut hole was small and the pretzel stick was making full contact with the donut’s ring. He remembered back in the day that his mates would make jokes about how space stations looked like something biological, even sexual. Those jokes were nothing now. He didn’t have that sense of humor anymore. This was no laughing matter. The main difference with Project Fireball and a normal station, was that a dangerous pronged fork was at the top end of the station. Well, rather, the bottom? He had a hard time talking about the station’s orientation to his subordinates, he always got it backwards. The fork always pointed at the planet it was targeting, but the main gravitational direction had your feet pointing away from the planet, so the station was, always upside-down, right? But the fork was always pointing up in his schematics. He remembered that the committee that designed this station didn’t think of the fork as a fork, they thought of it as a crown, symbolizing the Emperor, the Imperial Armada, and everything else that was wrong with this society.</p><p>He was going to do the work to get this station operational, but, and this was final: he was going to make contact with the Rebellion. There was nothing for it. No world, no matter how much they didn’t want to bow down to the greatest civilization that ever existed, was going to burn. Not on his watch.</p><hr /><p>Q’nall dragged the body over to a nearby tree, and propped it up against it. So glad we didn’t apparate into that tree, that would have been a disaster.</p><p>“Eenee, help me find some wreckage. We need some material to transfigurate into some food. You know how to do that, right?”</p><p>“Of course, that was Advanced Transfiguration, and I was pretty good at it.” She wiped some blood off her face and pulled out her sonic wand. “Accio wreckage!”</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>“Funny, E,” Q’nall said, chuckling a little under his breath. “You go look for something, anything, and I’ll stay here with our hostage. Explain the situation to them when they wake up.”</p><p>“Try asking some questions if they are up for it,” Eenee waved her hand as she walked away, “I’d begin with, ‘Where exactly are we? Do you recognize this grass?’”</p><p>“Still making jokes,” Q’nall said, with a wry smile. He shook his head. “Now let’s see if I can’t do some field magic here.”</p><p>“Good luck!” Eenee shouted. She was practically marching away towards some smoke on the horizon. “You were never any good at it. It’s a wonder you passed any exams!”</p><p>“Never did,” Q’nall said to himself, “never did.”</p><hr /><p>Tobial was nervous. He was looking at the core of Project Fireball. The actual core. Not a model, not a line drawing, the actual thing. He would destroy it right now if he thought of a way of doing it without killing himself or being sent to prison. And, if he did that, he would be getting his family into trouble as well. No, there was no way for it: he was going to have to somehow get the Rebellion in here to do the job. I mean, they don’t have families, right? That was the point, they don’t have families and that’s why they can stand to do what they do? Groups of loners? He didn’t really believe all of the news coming out of the state media outlet, but he figured that there was some basis for the lies. They have to be loners – otherwise, how could they justify the risk?</p><p>The core of Project Fireball was a giant crystal array. Keebler crystals, he thinks that’s the name, Keebler crystals powered the weapon. The way it works is that each crystal is engraved with a simple fire producing spell. The same kind of element-producing spell that first-year mages would learn, if he remembered correctly. But, because the crystal is exceptionally pure and well cut, it would multiply the effect twelvefold. But that’s only one of the crystals. This array had thousands upon thousands of crystals, each one engraved with the same spell. Once power is routed to the crystals, they start to cast those spells, But, the energy doesn’t stay in the same place, the energy is shunted out of the chamber by… that secondary crystal array. The focusing array. That takes the spell energy from the, the combustion array, and focuses it out of that chamber and into the fork, or crown, or barrel, whatever you wanted to call it. Actually, really the best way of describing this is like a giant version of a laser wand. The combustion array is like the core of a wand, except it’s huge, crystalline, and can only do one thing: summon fire. Then, the focusing array is like a focusing crystal in a laser wand: it takes the spell energy and turns it into a beam. If you cast a basic fire spell into a laser wand, what you get is a bolt of fire and light that travels forward, away from the wand in an approximately straight line. In the death station’s case, that line would be away from the combustion chamber, through the focusing array, and directly out into space. In a straight line. Which means that if the station was positioned over a planet, that beam would go directly to the planet. But, the fire energy wouldn’t have anything to feed off in space, so it would snuff itself out, correct? He took out the pad with the schematics on it again, and zoomed in on the fork. What was he missing? Oh, yes, the delay crystal. What does that do. Oh, it casts a metaspell on the firespell, keeping it in pre-realization form. So, normally when you have a delay spell, the energy doesn’t become well, real, until the delay spell wears off or is triggered to turn off by something. But what is it?</p><p>He looked more closely at the runes inscribed onto the delay crystal. He had to zoom in quite a lot to get to that level. At this scale, each rune was about as big as his head, which was quite small compared to the main combustion crystals, where each rune was about the size of a small snub fighter. This symbol means air, and that one means earth or ground, and that one means dry… what a moment. This is it, this is how it works. The fire spell isn’t meant to actualize in space. It’s meant to actualize on the planet’s surface. It’s not meant to blow a hole in the ground, or completely destroy the planet.</p><p>What it does is it sets fire to it. The whole planet, in wildfires. Oceans wouldn’t be effected of course, but this weapon is meant to take out anyone or anything living on the surface. All vegetation, on fire. Any wooden or flammable buildings, on fire. All food and food containers, on fire or melted. Wildlife? Cooked. Destruction. That’s what this weapon is capable of. Complete destruction.</p><p>Not destruction. Why would anyone set a planet on fire? Sure, that’s a good way of killing everyone, but then you don’t have a planet left. But wait, you do have a planet left. It’s just a little burnt, from a terraforming perspective. And the Empire is really good at terraforming worlds. They got plenty of practice even before our species journeyed out into space, and began exploring and then conquering the galaxy.</p><p>So, that was it. This weapon selectively destroys the planet’s biosphere and infrastructure, and makes it so that you can start terraforming from scratch. In fact, where are the terraforming spells? He looked at a different part of the schematic: the ring section of the ship. Yes, it had quarters, and several clusters of– that’s it, terraforming circuits. The station would use the same spell delivery system as the combustion chamber, but the feeds from the terraforming circuits ran parallel to them, So, all you’d have to do is turn off the fire crystals, block their output lines, and have the focusing crystals channel the terraforming spells instead of the death spell. That energy would go through the same delay circuits, and a beam of healing light would hit the devastated planet and start to grow life again. Imperial life. Human life.</p><p>This weapon was a genocide machine.</p><p>Tobial now understood why this station was the way it was. And now he had to figure out how to destroy it. In one stroke, the Rebellion needed to destroy this station. There were no chances after the first, the weapon could work on a spaceship just as well, especially if you turn off the delay circuit and re-positioned the station so that the beam was pointing at your target. Actually, no that was wrong, surely there was a different pathway. Oh yes, there where additional targeting crystals throughout the outer ring of the ship. They can use the same heart, but many different outputs.</p><p>This station was a fleet killer, too.</p><p>It needed to be destroyed forever. Even the schematics had to be destroyed. No one should be able to build this kind of weapon ever again. He was sure about that. The Rebellion needed this information. For his family’s sake, for all of the families in the galaxy. And even those without families. He needed to save them all.</p><p>Now, the easy part: getting to the Rebellion. I mean, that had to be easy, right? That was the easy part in all of the holovids about the rebels, or any other rebellion. You just had to show up in a dive bar, look for some suspicious people, and then say, “Death to tyrants!” and you got recruited. Maybe it wasn’t going to be that easy, and what if he gets caught? There’s no way that he was going to get caught, that would be the end of the mission, his life, and his family. There was no way that he could get caught. But what if he did? Time for a little planning. And I have to plan out the attack plan on the station, don’t I? Well, actually, if he got the information to the Rebellion in time, they could come up with an attack plan. That’s what those kids are good at. And they must be naturals, because Tobial didn’t think that terrorism was something you got taught in school.</p><p>Tobial decided that he had enough looking at the combustion crystal chamber. He was starting to think that he needed to lie low for a few days, to end any current suspicions of him, and to work on contacting the Rebellion. That was something he would probably have to do planetside. He had some vacation coming up. It would be good to be even more nervous than usual, and have the ship’s counselor suggest that he take a little vacation to the planet. Downwell will do you good, they’d probably say. Yes, he could use a vacation from this death station. And security on a planet is so much more lax than security on a space station. Especially this station. This station requires a level five clearance, and most people never get past three. He was considered to be one of the most loyal citizens in the whole Empire. That’s why what he was about to do was unthinkable, and the punishment is life-imprisonment. Although, he might be disappeared by the wrong branch of command for this kind of treason. The more secretive you live, the more secretive you die. That’s a good motto, that. I wonder if anyone has any mugs with that printed on it, so they can have secretive coffee breaks.</p><p>Tobial took the long way back to his room. That way he could pop in on the ship’s counselor on the way. One thing about the ships counselor here: he was not the usual sort of counselor. Normally, psychologists speak in a quiet, gentle tone, made to assure you that everything was going to be alright. Tobial quite liked normal psychologists; there was one in the family, as he recalled. Always wore elbow pads on this sweaters, if memory serves. No, this person they were calling ship’s counselor was more like ship’s loyalty consultant. Since this was a level five secret, the main thing they wanted was healthy minds with healthy loyalty. Nothing he did brought on fanaticism, but Tobial suspected that he didn’t discourage it either. He was there to make sure that no one was going to do what Tobial was definitely going to do: betray the Emperor.</p><p>In this case, the Emperor had betrayed the people by building this weapon. If this were used in the quashing of the Rebellion, that would be humans wiped from the face of the galaxy. No one should have that kind of power. Not even the darkest of dark wizards had that kind of power. If preventing those kinds of deaths that not even deatheaters could do, then by all means, Tobial is a traitor. The worst kind of person, at least from the Empire’s eyes. He supposed that he was going to have to start calling himself a rebel now. A rebel, him! But, no, he was loyal to the Empire, not a single Emperor. Rulers come and go but the Empire is the greatest civilization in the galaxy, and he was loyal to that, not to the current ruler. She will be stopped, but a better ruler will take her place.</p><hr /><p>The GRQ-117 was the most impressive ship that Q’nall had ever seen. It was a thing of derelict beauty, industrial grace, and some of dumpster chic as well. Whatever you said about the GRQ, it was a good ship with some interesting features. The main new feature was the partial heads up display in the helmet: theoretically it could make sure that you knew where you were no matter what direction you were going, and it had some builtin damage resistant spells to make it extra durable. The sigils in the heads up display were a little different, since they weren’t on the usual glass surface that adorns most magitech computer systems. This display was made of paper, and it still glowed with sigils, just more dimly. But you didn’t need to focus on them too much; they were close to your eyes and adjusted themselves accordingly. The main information that the mini heads up display had was that it showed your speed, and where your target was in relation to where you were looking. That means that if you followed your target with your eyes, you were able to see the information about them without looking down, like you had to with the traditional heads up display that was installed in the GRT series. This should make combat snappier, Q’nall told himself, this should come in handy in space battles, especially if you take some damage while you were going hunting.</p><p>Going hunting. Is that such a good euphemism for killing? Q’nall was still pretty young compared to some of the older officers, but really, a bit older than some of the fresh recruits. Most of the people in the Rebellion was the result of conquests that had been made in the last 10 years. The Empire was in an expansionist phase; maybe they slow down before they destroy too many more worlds. Or stopped forever, entirely. Q’nall didn’t think that the Empire could ever fall, but then again, there were all kinds of historical instances of institutions like Empires falling quickly after some crisis point. Was the Rebellion that crisis point? Was Q’nall a special member of a special group that will permanently change history forever? Will he be a footnote in some text? He couldn’t hope for that much credit. Just the fact that the Empire had been stopped invading Datyl was enough for him. He was glad that he wasn’t apart of the mission, because almost everyone was either captured or killed, but the Rebellion bought the Datyllians enough time to repair their planetary shielding that stopped the invasion by denying the ground troops ground to land on. And, since the planetary shield was up, that meant that the Rebellion could apparate out of there and leave the Datyllians a chance to fight on their own. The Imperial Armada fleet was pretty broken up at that point, and couldn’t defend against the planetary defense systems anymore. They were defeated, but it seems that was the brightest moment in the Rebellion’s history. Ever since then, the Rebellion had been on the run, resupplying from sympathizers as much as possible, but mostly, just camping out on border planets, hunting their own food, fighting skirmishes that were increasingly bloody, and all in all, just having a really shitty time about it.</p><p>Q’nall had joined somewhat early in the Rebellion’s history, but not during that initial conflict. He had been an Imperial ensign, fresh from the local Academy branch on Fillandtite, and still closeted. Still having to disguise who he was to everyone. Things used to be better: there were laws against discrimination. But the political winds had begun to change, ever since the Empire had expanded to double it’s original size just a hundred years ago. In that time, the government had become more repressive, and started to curtail certain rights officially, and ignore a few more basic ones routinely.</p><p>The fact is that Q’nall was a part of a whisper network of people that had survived into this increasing dark time. A whisper network that circulated the crimes that the Empire was starting to commit. It was all the new Empresses’ fault. She had spearheaded a lot of the new initiatives, and was convinced that the Empire had to expand or die. She made speeches about how the economy was stagnant and how it needed new markets or was going to collapse under it’s own weight, and that would mean starvation or worse for the average citizen. Lots of scare tactics. And the thing is, the human race had seen this sort of thing before. It had just been so long that most people had forgotten their ancient history lessons. Huh. I suppose that if the Empire employed more classicists, this thing probably wouldn’t happen. At least, that’s what Q’nall kept telling himself.</p><p>Anyway, the GRQ-117 was a hunk of junk, but he loved his. It even came with a little repair android. It looked like a child, but it didn’t speak, at least, not in a language that he could understand. He was told that the language was Robotic, and that it took magitechnitions years to understand it, and even longer to speak it. It was interesting, they said. No one had actually written it, it just sort of evolved among the androids that were human shaped but weren’t equipped with a vocalizer spell.</p><p>Q’nall would have to contemplate this later, as there was a mission coming up – he was going to be assigned to protect a convoy of ships. That convoy must get through, no matter what, which is why Delta Squadron was going to get in there. They were the squadron you wanted if you wanted something to change. Usually for the better, although they were pretty loose with the term “better.” Most of the time they were there to clean up some mess that someone had made. They were adaptable, and they were all good pilots. The Rebellion couldn’t do much better than Delta Squadron, although they couldn’t do much better anyway.</p><p>Q’nall was the most junior member of the Squadron, which meant that he got to do all the “best” jobs. Like flying out of a dangerous situation first, so that he wouldn’t get hurt. That was patronizing to him, although he was grateful that he didn’t die all those times. OK, not patronizing, but pretty close. If he were immature, which he only is sometimes when he feels like it</p><hr /><p>Tobial was worried, always worried, but this was about at the limit of what he was capable of feeling. This was worse than that time his younger child stepped on a sharp tack that was left in the ground somehow. He didn’t even own any tacks, what was this the 20th century? Don’t ask questions, I’ll tell you no lies. Now, what was happening to Tobial was a feeling of dread before going on what could be considered a suicide mission. He was going to break into a secure scholastic space station and deliver a message to the Rebellion, and somehow walk away from it without getting caught? What was he thinking, surely he was going mad. Is this was losing your mind felt like, feeling compelled to save the galaxy? When really you were a nobody. Then again, he wasn’t a nobody anymore, he was the main engineer of the project, and he was able to get enough information to piece together the horrible superweapon that he was helping to create. He didn’t have any way of contacting the Rebellion, up until now that is. The secret news of the hostage situation at the school meant that he was going to get in there without a lot of questions, since the press wasn’t allowed there. All he would have to do is to apparate in there, find the rebel, give them the pad, and be out, just like that. Maybe he would learn a way to contact the Rebellion in the future? Like, a secret radio handshake or something? No, don’t think about all that spy versus spy stuff, you need to focus on the task at hand, which is getting that information to the Rebellion. That’s all that mattered at this point.</p><p>He looked at his layout of the school again. What should be the entrance of the school was clearly not the place to start, so he began to trace different walkways through the school, starting at the entrance and working away. He was trying to figure out where he would keep the hostages. It had to be far enough away from the entrance to make evading the Armada officers easier, but not so cornered that you had to where to run when you needed to evade them. Like a maze puzzle that he used to do when he was small, Tobial traced path after path through the school. He was about to give up when it occurred to him: the gymnasium was far enough away from everything that it made sense to hide out there. But the main court was too open… aha, the equipment room. That’s where he’d look first. And with a good enough scry spell, he’d be able to see what was in there before he apparated in. Now, because the school is also a space station, that means that you can’t just apparate in there, it was too far away from the planet to make it normally. You’d need some kind of booster spell, probably some kind of building with some kind of gateway in it or something, that was a pretty common solution to the problem of traveling to and fro space stations. But that would likely get you into the entrance, so that wasn’t going to work. He was going to have to make sure that no one sees him coming or going into the school.</p><p>Then, it hit him, like a moment of clarity that he had heard so much about in stories. The food barge, of course. It would take too long to bring in food through the people gateway, so that means that there had to be a food barge or, the equivalent of a dummy elevator, right? There had to be, and he was going to smuggle himself in that transport. That would probably take him right to the kitchens, which were also a pretty good place to start this mission. So, that’s what was going to happen. He was going to board a food delivery ship to get onto the station, apparate into the gymnasium supply closet, and then march to the place where they were holding the hostages. This was going to work. This was going to work after all.</p></div><div class="metadata"><div class="date" title="Zettel date"><time datetime="2020-11-24T21:20">2020-11-24</time></div></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">scene/02</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.20.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
