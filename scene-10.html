They weren’t certain that the food barge was going to go exactly where they expected it to go. There were all kinds of factors. Things that they couldn’t possibly anticipate. Murphy’s law was as certain as the sun. Something was going to go wrong, he was sure of it. Tobial had never left anything to chance in his entire life, and now he was going to have to do something risky for a good cause. For a good cause, mind you. But still, risky.</p><p>Tobial went over the plan over and over in his head. There was anymore any number of things that could go wrong, like for instance, what if the pilot decides to take a break right before the docking procedure? What if the other officer is late? Timing was everything in an operation like this, and there was little room for uncertainty. It took a lot of credits to get all of them onto this barge, and that wasn’t including the bribe that he had to make to the port master to even get into the barge. What was the excuse that he used? Oh right, he was smuggling drugs. That was a common enough reason to want access to cargo without a permit. It was reason enough to choose that particular port master, she was notorious for allowing contraband into the station. After all, how else were people going to get their drugs? Life in Project Fireball was stressful, and the personnel that peopled that station were high stress individuals, and the drugs helped them cope with what they were doing. I’m sure that the high command of the station was even indulging in drugs, to keep their conscience clear. Anything for the Empire, he supposed. Then again, he wasn’t working for the Empire exclusively anymore, was he? No, he was slowly turning into a Rebel, and that scared him just a bit. He knew that change was something that didn’t come easily to people, especially him. He hadn’t even changed his breakfast for 10 years. But now he was becoming a rebel, and that was a huge change in his world. And at some point, he wasn’t going to be able to see his family any more. That hurt him. He had already written many letters to his family, begging for forgiveness for his actions. Explaining why he was doing it. Explaining that someday, he would be exonerated as a hero, not a traitor. It was going to be history to be the judge of him, not the Empress or anyone else. History would decide if what he did here today was righteous or not. And he was betting on history seeing it his way, the way of the Rebellion, the way of the Empire not committing horrible war crimes in the name of a single Empress.</p><hr /><p>There wasn’t anyway that they were going to get out of this alive, was there? There was just no way. They were going to die as traitors, and no one was going to mourn them. Well, the Rebellion was going to mourn them, since they were traitors to. What was he thinking? He shouldn’t have let Tobial talk him into this mission. There were too many risks, and that meant that he was going to die. He was going to be a tragic hero to the Rebellion, but a traitor to the empire, and that means that he wasn’t going to get buried properly. That means that he’s not going to be cremated and shot into space like he wanted to. Well, maybe that can be done from the Rebellion stronghold on Gorgaplax. That would be the kind of thing that they might do. They were once Imperial citizens, so they understand the burial rites just like anyone else.</p><p>You see, burial in the ground was considered a wasteful thing to do, like littering or dumping garbage into a pure mountain stream. It was considered pollution, and pollution was what caused the original climate crisis on Earth, wasn’t it? That’s what happened. Of course, Earth is no longer in danger, but that’s because people stopped burying their dead. Well, some religions still practiced it, but they were grandfathered in. All new, sanctioned burials were in space. Some places that were popular to place a memorial was in Kuiper belts, or other asteroid belts in whatever system that you lived in. Others opted to just be sent out into space, with a tracking system of course, if someone needed to find you. Because asteroid belts were an environmental feature in the star systems that they appear in, that means that they are under some of the same environmental concerns as planetary bodies. That’s why it was popular to send yourself into space. Some people preferred to be shot into their star for their system, but that was pretty rare, but growing in popularity. Because of the advances in magical medicine, they can keep a sort of hologram of your body so that they can do any examinations on that body without needing the original. Still, some people were sentimental about remains, and had their loved ones encased in a block of carbon that served as an urn of sorts.</p><hr /><p>There was a time when she would have gave anything to play football professionally, but now that wasn’t going to happen, was it? Maybe the thing to do is to just accept the fact that life doesn’t always go where you want it to.</p><p>In fact, what she wanted to do more than anything was to see her favorite team, the Gravity Wellingtons, play in their home stadium at V’stanqi IV. There was going to be some kind of championship game there soon, but since she started working with the Rebellion, she didn’t have any idea of what was going on in the world of zero-g football. At least, not at the level that she was accustomed to at school. When she was in school, she programmed her phone to update her on the tiniest bit of football news that the magic could find. That was the beauty of the magical future: anyone can program their devices with magical spells, and it mostly worked. Spreadsheets were mere child’s play compared to what she could do with a phone and a lot of magical reading about creating a definition of football news. It was impressive. Her magitech professor was impressed. In fact, she got extra credit when she shared her secrets to the class in a special presentation. Maybe that was something she could do in the Rebellion, Harriet thought. She could be some kind of engineer. But that’s not the same as football is it? Football is life, and you could not take that away from her. There would be some soul searching to do if she couldn’t play football, but she was going to take care of that later. Now, she needs to focus on the current mission, which was to do what again? She never had a military mind, at least, not when it came to mission briefings. She could never get all the details down. She didn’t see anyone else taking notes, so she didn’t see a reason for her to. If they could do it, she could. She just needed to be better at remembering things. Maybe she could ask someone in private if they could remember things like they seem to, or if they were faking somehow. That would be a laugh. All the senior staff of the Rebellion not knowing what they were doing, that was absurd.</p><p>Still, as her smart friend has always said, it never hurts to ask questions. In class, and in life. Well, this was going to be some kind of thing about that, isn’t it? Harriet hated when her smart friend was right. There was something about her that made her realize that she really was her best friend, despite the fact that she knew next to nothing about football. She wondered what she thought of Harriet now, as a Rebellion fighter. Maybe there was a way to convince her to join the cause? No, there was no way that her smartest friend would be that stupid. No way.</p><p>Ven-tika, now, maybe she would be a Rebellion fighter. She was always talking about the Rebellion news, and now much she was jealous of them. Maybe she could be recruited? Hm, it might be worth the risk. School was almost over, so there would be little time in trying to get her to come over to the Rebellion before she started doing whatever it was that she decided to do with her life.</p><hr /><p>So, does smart friend get into the Rebellion? I think that the way that it works is either she goes in with Harriet from the beginning, which is a lot more like Star Wars and Harry Potter, or does she join for different reasons in a later story? I think that I’d like her to join the adventure as early as possible, and she can find someone to fall in love with too. Maybe the ghost? Just kidding, no one ends up with a ghost in this story. I mean, how would that work? There’s no physical contact, so it would all be in the realm of the mind, right? Do you read smut to each other when one or both of the participants are ghosts? I cannot figure that part out, and I won’t have to, because I’m not writing that scene…unless I get really bored or something. But I don’t see that happening.</p><p>So, Harriet, Jem, and now smart friend are coming along for the ride, is that enough people? Or is it following a rule of three or something? I mean, I guess I should count Q’nall in that, and Tobial. Now, who is Eenee? That was a character that I wrote about a lot in the beginning of Q’nalls adventure, when he wasn’t going to be part of the school station paper. I think that would be the start of the second book, if there is going to be a second book. I might decide to turn this into a trilogy, since that my source material is split up into an epic story line with multiple entries in it. It would be a shame to have just one book, if I can have three. We’ll see. I think that I could be some sort of writer without a series, but I kinda like the idea of having one, since this is space opera, it should be epic and sweeping. So, what I should do is focus on writing the first book, but also figure out plot points that could exist in the future. I think that each struggle should some kind of thing that is epic too. Like, they damage the station, don’t destroy it, so they have to come up with another plan to stop it? Or the station is destroyed, but they start building another superweapon? No, I don’t like that at all. That’s too Star Wars. In Harry Potter, they have a combination of the same villains and new villains in each book. I think that I could do something like that, where the Empress is the same, but she has different generals that all have different ideas of how to conquer more worlds. The first one is the space station, that’s how they all get together. The second plot could be related to B’s idea of using sympathetic magic to commit genocide, kind of like how Teatime tries to control children in The Hogfather. I think that’s the most epic one, so I’d leave that to the third book. I think that the second book needs something equally creative, or it’ll end up being filler and I don’t like that about middle books and movies. The middle should also be good, and not filler. So, how do I make a second book that isn’t filler? Nothing with time travel, there is no time traveling in this story, otherwise the whole thing becomes time travel. I will not use time travel as a one off plot point, thank you much.</p><p>I think that the second book in this trilogy would be something like, I don’t know, a direct military threat, kinda like in Empire Strikes Back, where the Rebellion has to struggle a bit and a lot of people die. The Rebellion has to deal with their victory because they are declared an Enemy of the State and thus have a lot more military presence going after them. Basically, the Empire declares war against the Rebellion. In which the Rebellion has to figure out it’s destiny, and Harriet ends up having a lot to do with how it goes. She thinks that the Rebellion should create their own civilization, and a lot</p><hr /><p>So, the world was going to come to an end, at least as far as Tobial was concerned. He was going to have all kinds of problems with this new order of things. He didn’t come here to start a new nation? One without an Empress or anything even! A participatory democracy? What kind of nonsense was that? There shouldn’t be that kind of thing in the universe anymore, participatory democracies can’t work in the space age. There was once a word that described what Tobial was, but he didn’t know it. It started with an F and ended with ascist. Tobial was in charge of his family, or at least he used to be. He missed them so much. Now that there was a war declared on the Rebellion, there was no way that he was going to make it back alive, was he? The death station was destroyed, wasn’t it? That was the end of the deal. He wanted to go back to the Empire, but he needed to do something that endeared the empire to love him and accept him again. There was nothing to be gained here, and he knew it in his heart, that he didn’t belong with these space hippies. He had to go home, but how? How was he going to go home?</p><p>He was going to have to betray his new friends, wasn’t he? But then again, he was done with them in terms of their usefulness to him, wasn’t he? They weren’t really his friends, not if they knew that he was going to have to betray them. That was it, he was going to have to betray his new friends, in order to gain his old family back. And the family was the most important thing to Tobial Bee, the family. He was going to sell the Imperial government military secrets. That was how he was going to win favor back in the Empire. He was going to trade secrets for clemency. He wondered how far that his spy activities were going to have to go in order for him to get back into the Empire. It wasn’t going to be easy, that’s for sure. He was going to have to use every bit of his cunning to get those secrets out before he gets caught.</p><p>This is how the second book would go: The war is declared, and Tobial starts to betray the Rebellion to the Empire, and that’s how the Empire starts to win the war. By the end of the story, the Empire will be held back and nearly defeated after Tobial’s betrayal is exposed. He doesn’t make it home, and he is killed in an offensive that he helped plot against the Rebellion. His family get his letters, and they are exposed to the public to garner support for the war effort. It backfires though, because the letters expose the project fireball plan and thus makes the Empress look bad. That is the climate in which the third book begins, with the Empire on the run, and trying desperately to find a weakness in the Rebellion. But they can’t so they turn to genocide. The plan is that if they kill the right aliens</p><hr /><p>Space shovels are stupid, Harriet decided, definitively. Why did she need to use one? Oh right, to dig out trenches for the upcoming battle. Space shovels. They should be able to dig themselves, right? Yes, Harriet was convinced that she could magic the shovels into doing her work for her. So she, set about for her wand, and started to think about exactly which spell would be her friend here. She didn’t know that many spells, so she decided to do what she always did; get her smartest friend to do it for her, or rather, help her find it herself. Yes, that’s right, she wasn’t going to MAKE her do it, just help her out.</p><p>What ends up happening after the spell was cast is like, the scene from Fantasia where the brooms start to do too much work? Yeah, same thing happens with the shovels. There’s a messy part where they get covered in mud trying to cover up their mistake, and then they end up in front of the ghost general to explain themselves. That’s when they hear the news about Q’nall and Eenee getting transported to a random Imperial planet, and their mission is to find Q’nall and Eenee and bring them back. At the point, Harriet and Q’nall are full on lovers, but they are in the honeymoon phase, so they haven’t had any arguments yet.</p><hr /><p>Is there Zoom in the future? Of course, there is, Star wars clearly has holographic communication, so that’s no problem. Three is of course that blue sheen that holograms have, but that’s no problem.</p></div><div class="metadata"><div class="date" title="Zettel date"><time datetime="2020-11-24T21:32">2020-11-24</time></div></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">scene/10</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.23.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
