The Rebellion’s flagship, the Alien Friendship, was losing atmosphere
and fast. It had no power, and they were all kinds of other stuff wrong
with it. It was not the place to be right now, so Harriet, Jem, and
their parents were all going to get onto escape pods and really get out
of there as quickly as possible. So, they ran. Ran, ran, ran, ran and
ran. They were surrounded by dead bodies all the way to the escape pods.
And that wasn’t all. A few of the escape pods had dead bodies in them,
so that was a pretty hard thing to do, to remove dead bodies, so you
could live. that kind of thing gives you nightmares and permanent mind
scars, so don’t do it kids. unless you have to. to survive. and that was
what they were doing right now, surviving.

It was survival that they had in mind when they decided to board
separate escape pods. They were pretty small, and so they were thinking
about the oxygen atmosphere in them running out. So they split up. There
was no reason why that was a bad idea right? They were going to wind up
in about the same place, so there was no way that they were going to die
separately.

That’s what exactly happened. Just as her parents pod was launched it,
and the two people inside, were killed. There was nothing that anyone
could do about it.
