# Migrating to Neuron

I'm migrating my blog again, and this time migrating to a personal wiki system called [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page). 

## Migratory Blogs

This is not the first time that I've considered and done the migration dance for my personal website. I keep telling myself that I'll find the promised land of blog management systems, something that will allow me to publish to the web in a way that makes sense to me. Really, what all this usually ends up doing is wasting a bunch of time. But is it a waste, really?

## Using Cerveau

I'm experimenting with using the [Cerveau app](https://cerveau.app) for editing things, for a couple of reasons:

- I really like Neuron and want to continue to use it
- This is a web interface, which is something that is useful if a development machine goes down or I need to make a quick edit online
- I want to help support srid, and this is a way to do that

## Why Neuron?

At first, it was mostly because it was a personal wiki system written in Haskell that mostly operated on the commandline. However, I became intrigued by the web components after I starting using Cerveau, and tweaking how the site was generated with the `neuron gen` command.

The final reason why I like Neuron is because the files are in Markdown format, and srid is really working on keeping the extensions to the format as little as possible. That means that I can keep the same files and if I decide to move to a different platform, I can bring my files with me.
