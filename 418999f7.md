Speaking of trying, should the romance between Harriet and Q'nall be
really awkward at first, or should it be like really good for them the
whole time. IF they are trigger each other's Intuition about each other,
then there doesn't have to be an awkward period, does there? Eh, there
should be, that's pretty common in these kinds of stories, and that
other approach just seems to pollyannaish to me. So, there will be
awkwardness. But how does it happen? I want to know what dating
experiences are like for trans folks. I want to have my other desk up
here, this is ridiculous, I want to have a proper desk to work at, and my
desk downstairs is no long a proper desk. Well, it is a proper desk, but
not a proper work station, because of all the crap that is in there. I
want to make sure that there is a desk down there for anyone who needs
that desk, so I'm going to swap the desks. This desk can go downstairs
with that bad chair, and that desk can come up here to live with me. And
I'll have the desktop computer just headless and running web services,
and its going to be great, you wait and see.
