Harriet lightly touched the surgical scars on Q’nall’s forehead. “Does
that, still hurt?”

“No, it doesn’t hurt, and the scars with go away someday too.”

“Why do you have them?”

“Well, in my species, men don’t have horns. So, since I had them, I had
to have them removed, because I’m a trans man. Does that bother you?”

“I, I didn’t know that aliens could be trans.” Harriet pulled her hand
away and looked at Q’nall in a new and slightly suspicious way.

“Well, not all of them, but most of the species that have two sexes have
some form of trans people. Personally, I think it’s the same for any
species, but some of them just haven’t accepted it yet. That’s my theory
anyway.”

Harriet found herself needing to ask a question, but it was far too
embarrassing to ask directly. Q’nall sensed that there was a question,
not what it was. He decided not to ask about it, he had a bad feeling
that it was something that he’d been asked over and over again, like,
‘what do your genitals look like’ or something like that.

“Nall, I have something to ask you,” Harriet said, somewhat bravely.

“Okay, Hare, what is it? Anything.” Here it comes…

“Is everybody in your species pink?”

Q’nall was surprised by this question. He thought everyone knew about
his people’s skin color. By space Jesus, they all knew about human skin
colors.

“I’m pink because my mother was pink,” he said finally, “Does that
answer your question?”

“Yes, I think so. I’ll just have to wait and meet more of your people to
learn about you.”

Q’nall and Harriet started holding hands. “If we ever see any of my
people again, I promise you, you’ll get to meet them.”
