# sehqlr's Zettelkasten

Welcome to my zettelkasten (roughly, "cabinet of notes").

I'm making a transition from having my writings being in a blog format, see [[998f64f5]]. The TL;DR is that I'm going to continue to write and publish, but it'll be in this personal wiki format.

[Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page) is still under active development, and I'm a sponsor for the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/srid/neuron). If srid meets his funding goal, then he will open-source [Cerveau](https://cerveau.app), which is what I'm using for some edits of this zettelkasten.

This wiki is currently under development as well. I had a lot of content that I added here without the intention of making it public, or centralized. I'm working on making the site more navigable. For instance, I plan on having an entire resume system embedded in this wiki, so that's going to take some time.
