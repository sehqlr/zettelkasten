The war was never started. But, from another perspective, the war was
never over. For someone like the Empress, she had the right vision. She
new about wars, and how they never ended. There would always be wars.
There always have been wars. It’s just a part of history, war is the
dividing principal, like a clock splits time into seconds. Wars were the
bookmarks of history, the bookends, too. Everything is war, you just
have to accept that. There will never be an end to war. Her people had
forgotten that. They were too pacifistic while they were out exploring
the galaxy, and that gave them a reputation to uphold. Well, she was
going to change that. She was fairly young for a human ruling the
species. Some say that your early 30s are when you truly know yourself,
or at least that’s when people start to learn about themselves. That is
when you really start to listen to yourself. Well, the Empress
discovered that she wanted to be the Empress. She really wanted to be
the ruler of a warrior caste, out in the wilderness killing monsters and
game animals for her?
