He was flying in a snub fighter on the edge of the Empire, trying to find that last enemy ship that slipped from his sights just minutes ago. He had to get every last one if the convoy was going to be safe. And they needed that convoy to get through more than anything. Khell needed those supplies, at least, the secret base they had on Khell had to get those supplies. The polar regions were often not searched, since they counted as wilderness to the Empire, and frozen wastes were often not a priority for the Imperial troops. They were more focused on oppressing people. At least, that’s what they said at the base. Q’nall was a young Fillandtite, with pink skin and purple head ridges. (Harriet is black.) Q’nall, or just Nall to his close associates, had been in the Rebellion ever since his homeworld was conquered by the Empire, and his people submitted to their Armada. Political dissidents were imprisoned immediately of course. That was the story on every planet the Empire conquered. If you acted like the Empire was the best thing since garmok bread, they treated you almost like equals, but if you disagreed with anything, you were disappeared. Holobloggers had certainly been disappeared from the holonet for sure. That was not at all surprising. Q’nall wasn’t really surprised.</p><p>Q’nall rubbed his surgery scars on his forehead. He surgically transitioned last winter, which was less than a standard year ago. They were going to have to change the calendar, weren’t they? What would be the use of using a calendar of the oppressor? Isn’t that the whole point of rebellion, to change basic unfair things like calendars? Okay, maybe that would go a bit too far, what was he thinking. Q’nall never had much use for calendars anyway, it was a primarily human preoccupation with time. Linear reckoning of time from when the Empire was founded. Maybe, just maybe, the calendars will have a celebration day for the Rebellion sometime in the future. But, he was going to have to find that fighter first. Somewhere in this system, an Imperial pilot was getting reading to apparate away and he had to stop them, otherwise this whole operation was blown. He started to unfocus his eyes, and let the Force take over. He was Force sensitive, that’s why he was able to guess really well sometimes. At least, that’s what the base psychologist said. But, what did Brillious really know? His specialty was in android psychology, and last time he checked, he was a Fillandtite, not a robotic being. Sure, he had a replacement hand, but practically everyone in the Rebellion had replacement parts from losing limbs on missions. They didn’t have the necessary potion ingredients for growing parts back, so they relied on robotic parts instead. What the rebellion wouldn’t give for some eye of space newt or whatever they needed. Q’nall was not much of a magic user, almost completely inept, but he had enough training in basic combat magic to be able to get a laser pistol to work if it jammed, but other than that he was useless. Like, if he were in a duel, he’d have to rely on like, mud-slinging or something that you see in the holovids. And that’s assuming that the other person had never seen a holovid. Or wasn’t moving. Luckily for Q’nall, most of his combat happened in the cockpit of a fighter, and that was a place where you didn’t really need magic. Just skills. I mean, having an android in the second seat was helpful if that android was equipped with repair magic, but combat-wise, Q’nall had it covered. He was relentless. Which is why that enemy fighter wasn’t going to get away.</p><p>The stars began to drop away for Q’nall as he felt the presence of the Force. Where was the other fighter? Where, where, where… there. There, right in the Lagrange point. There was no way that the gravimetric sensors would have detected it there. It was a clever spot to hide. And if they were hidden for another minute, they would have gotten away. It takes a lot of magic to apparate a person, let alone a whole ship, but it’s still done all the time.</p><p>The enemy fighter was powered down, which means that their shields would be minimal. Q’nall knew that if he could just approach where the ship was without detection, it would be an easy kill. Too easy. Then, it hit him: if he was able to disable the ship, but not destroy it, they could take a prisoner. And a prisoner was much more valuable than a dead person. Q’nall radioed the nearest friendly ship.</p><p>“To the nearest AFL ship, I need help disabling an enemy, does anyone copy?”</p><p>The magic powers of the space radios sent the signal nearly instantaneously to every nearby ship, of which there were about seven. The nearest one to Q’nall replied, “Nall, this is Eenee, repeat that last message?”</p><p>Q’nall opened a direct channel to Eenee. “There’s an enemy fighter shutdown in that Lagrange point, which means that we could disable, rather than destroy, that ship, and that means that we could take a prisoner.”</p><p>“What do you need me to do Nall?”</p><p>“Just follow me and set your weapons to a lower setting, were going to take a prisoner!”</p><p>Q’nall activated his fighter’s engines to maximum speed. The enemy ship could apparate at any moment, and then this mission would be lost. But, if this works out, the mission will have been a success plus a little extra treat of having a live prisoner in the camp. This was going to be a turning point in the whole war, he just knew it. This was going to be written down in the history books for sure. Maybe he’ll even get to pick out the star of the holovid they would definitely make about him and this mission. But, he was getting ahead of himself. Time to focus.</p><p>“Nall,” Eenee radioed, “What about our signatures? Won’t that ship detect us and apparate away before we get there? Even a small jump and we’ll loose them.”</p><p>“I have an idea. Cut your power once you reach full speed, we’ll coast in.”</p><p>They did so. The two ships flew in harmony, revving up their engines, getting to full speed, and then cutting power. It was a daring maneuver but it was going to work this time.</p><p>The ships flew silently through space. The sigils on the heads-up-display were all bright red, or not even showing up at all. That means that everything was working perfectly. The enemy ship had no chance of catching them as long as they were drifting. As far as the finding spells were concerned, they should appear as drift, interstellar junk, flotsam. Instead, what they should have revealed was two Rebellion ships bearing down on them.</p><p>Just as the enemy was starting to power up their ship to apparate out of there, Q’nall and Eenee rapidly floated to the enemy ship’s position and opened fire. The first few volleys were unsuccessful, they completely missed the target because the enemy ship moved out of the way of the blasts of magical energy.</p><p>“Damn, there goes our surprise, Nall,” Eenee shouted into her radio transmitter, “Looks like we are going to have to destroy this ship. We can’t jeopardize the mission, you know that.”</p><p>“We might be able to disable them still, just keep them from apparating out of here. You keep taking the shots, I’ll cover you.” Q’nall began to reactivate his ships systems to get ready for a dog fight. He flipped toggles in the proper sequence. Normally this kind of thing is a preflight check that you take slowly so your ship doesn’t get destroyed in the vacuum of space by a systems failure. The fact that he was doing this while also trying to take down a fighter would have gotten a talking to from his commanding officer for sure.</p><p>His engines fully charged, he began attack pattern upsilon, a pretty rare maneuver that involved flying in a chaotic pattern that is meant to throw the enemy off balance, but requires a great deal of balance itself.</p><p>“Careful Nall, your ship is getting too close, I might hit you,” Eenee’s voice came over the comm system, the radio that operates at greater than the speed of light, it operates at the speed of magic.</p><p>“Take the shot!” Q’nall shouted into his radio, “Don’t worry about me!” Q’nall was still swaying his ship back and forth, getting closer and closer to his target. The Imperial fighter wasn’t having much luck evading his attack pattern, but Q’nall was determined to capture the enemy and take them prisoner. He knew that the ship would have to divert power to the apparation drive to be able to jump out of normal space, and based on the intelligence reports they’ve stolen, these Imperial ships have to be nearly at a standstill in order to activate the drive. Because he was closing in on them, the enemy couldn’t apparate.</p><p>Unless.</p><p>The enemy ship started to glow. The light became more and more bright, more and more powerful. The enemy ship was still dodging both the magical blasts from Eenee and the buzzing annoyance of Q’nall, but the apparation drive was clearly activating. Not in the way that it normally operates, but it was clearly… overloading? Q’nall couldn’t believe it, were they going to self-destruct? No, that didn’t make sense.</p><p>Unless, they were diverting all their weapon power into the drive. That explains the glowing energy field, it looks exactly like when a weapon system is about the explode. But in this case, if they were skilled enough, they might be able to regulate the power flow and be able to activate the spell circuitry when the apparation core was charged enough. But it looks like the drive is overloading and could explode. If that drive isn’t activated soon, the enemy pilot, Eenee, and Q’nall would all die.</p><p>“I’m closing in, Nall, I can’t get a good shot,” Eenee shouted over the comm system, “Keep on their tail, I’m the cavalry.”</p><p>“No!” Q’nall was desperate enough to pull the radio transmitter closer to his face, “We’ll be destroyed–”</p><p>There was a flash of light, and all three ships disappeared from normal space.</p></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header">Backlinks</h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container cf"><span class="zettel-link"><a href=".">sehqlr’s Zettelkasten</a></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"><li class="item"><div class="pandoc"><em>Parent directory zettel</em></div></li></ul></li></ul></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.10.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
