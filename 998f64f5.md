# Migrating to Neuron

I'm considering migrating my blog again, and this time migrating to a personal wiki system called [Neuron](neuron.zettel.page). 

## Migratory Blogs

This is not the first time that I've considered and done the migration dance for my personal website. I keep telling myself that I'll find the promised land of blog management systems, something that will allow me to publish to the web in a way that makes sense to me. Really, what all this usually ends up doing is wasting a bunch of time. But is it a waste, really?

## Using Cerveau

I'm experimenting with using the [Cerveau app](cerveau.app) for editing things, for a couple of reasons:

- I really like Neuron and want to continue to use it
- This is a web interface, which is something that is useful if a development machine goes down or I need to make a quick edit online
- I want to help support srid, and this is a way to do that
