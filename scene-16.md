Space shovels are stupid, Harriet decided, definitively. Why did she
need to use one? Oh right, to dig out trenches for the upcoming battle.
Space shovels. They should be able to dig themselves, right? Yes,
Harriet was convinced that she could magic the shovels into doing her
work for her. So she, set about for her wand, and started to think about
exactly which spell would be her friend here. She didn't know that many
spells, so she decided to do what she always did; get her smartest
friend to do it for her, or rather, help her find it herself. Yes,
that's right, she wasn't going to MAKE her do it, just help her out.

What ends up happening after the spell was cast is like, the scene from
Fantasia where the brooms start to do too much work? Yeah, same thing
happens with the shovels. There's a messy part where they get covered in
mud trying to cover up their mistake, and then they end up in front of
the ghost general to explain themselves. That's when they hear the news
about Q'nall and Eenee getting transported to a random Imperial planet,
and their mission is to find Q'nall and Eenee and bring them back. At
the point, Harriet and Q'nall are full on lovers, but they are in the
honeymoon phase, so they haven't had any arguments yet.
