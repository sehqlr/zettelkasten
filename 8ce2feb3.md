# Quotable

I will teach my generation  
how to enjoy  
a television show  
No need to hang about  
a room, empty  
but with favored quotes and moments  
did you see in season 4  
when they— Yes!  
(haha) “that's what she said”  
(haha)  
No need to repeat them over  
(haha) over  
(haha) over  
sonic reruns  

No need to pester  
those unindoctrinated in the occult knowledge of pretend antics  
that writers, actors, directors (etc) invented for entertainment  
there are too many shows to ravish  

We remember what's said  
but  
pound stone, then stone is flat, then sand  
Please, brew popcorn and WATCH the show.
