Dear Shawn:

Hey dude, what is up? How is the “business”? I hope you haven’t been
caught yet. You know how those border patrol policemen are. In your
latest mailings, I’ve noticed that our code names change more than they
used to. Are “the pancakes getting burnt”? In response to the
police-tape-recorded conversation we had on the 25th, you having
“bacon that was too high in cholesterol”, I decided to tell the
advantages of using American technology incorporated into your backwater
dealings. Because of the way our corporations have taken over the
country, all of these programs (that’s the magic that comes from
computers, didn’t ya know) are from Microsoft. I hope that doesn’t
bother you any.

1.  Microsoft Word is a wonderful word processor. A word processor is a
    program that works like a magic typewriter. Not only does it type,
    but it also corrects your spelling errors (for the most part), and
    it allows you to *make multiple copies of the same letter*! The only
    downfall to this system is that you have to buy a printer, paper,
    and ink for it, but these are good investments for your business.
2.  Besides making multiple copies of the same letter, you can also use
    the Mail Merge Wizard to make multiple copies of the same letter
    *with different names on it*! This is particularly good for making
    one money-demanding letter and sending it to all of your customers,
    each one personalized to their own name!
3.  The other program that I want to mention to you is very useful in
    managing business. It is called Microsoft Excel. It is a spreadsheet
    program, that is, a program that does all sorts of cool math. That’s
    right: MATH!!! It is especially good for keeping track of all of the
    money you’ve made, all of the money you have yet to collect, and how
    much hush money you still owe.

Of course, you will have to have someone show you how to do this stuff,
or you might just “hire” somebody to do it for you. Once you have
mastered Word and Excel, you will have less office trash and you won’t
have as many problems with finding your “receipts”.

Hopefully not in jail or dead,

Samuela Smokestoomuch.
