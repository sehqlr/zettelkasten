I was thinking about how there is a question about the Dursleys. Are
there any Dursleys in this story? So far, I’ve never said that Harriet
ever lives anywhere else than on the station, but I suppose that there
could be the equivalent of a summer break where students would visit
their families. That’s probably a pretty standard thing in boarding
schools.

So, what is this family like? Are they bad people that Harriet hates and
that they hate Harriet, or are they supportive? Or maybe just
indifferent? Well, wait, Harriet’s parents are still alive in the story,
so that means that she would be living with her parents, and that means
no Dursleys. That’s fine, I thought that was something that wouldn’t add
too much to the story. That certainly doesn’t match up with star wars at
all.

So, no durselys, what about the weasleys? Well, we establish that
Harriet goes to live with Jem’s family, and we could temporarily call
them the weasleys, but I don’t think I want to do that, I think that
they are going to be called the Barrows, after the Barrow from Harry
Potter.
