A+ Journals for Sam Hatfield in the Fourth Hour, to be turned in to
Mrs. Ruether

### 3/28/05

Inkheart is a book that I found in the classroom. It was a good book in
my opinion, although I missed out on the class activities.

### 3/30/05

Because there are no more interesting books to read, I have to pay
attention to the class. Darn

### 4/1/05

The class is now starting on Tom Sawyer, and doing an end-of-the-year
project on it.

### 4/4/05

I started reading Tom Sawyer during reading time. I am greatly reminded
why it is a good book.

### 4/6/05

I read aloud out of Tom Sawyer today. After I finished, everyone thought
I should read aloud more often

### 4/8/05

I read aloud again. All the kids were saying “I wish I could read like
that!”

### 4/11/05

If reading is boring, why don’t they make it interesting to read with
excitement.

### 4/13/05

Class discussion today. Went rather well, everyone participated. It was
nice.

### 4/15/05

Class discussion again. Didn’t go well at all. Very disruptive behavior.

### 4/18/05

The seating arrangment changed a little while ago. The students that sat
away from the teacher were the bad ones again, even though the people
were different.

### 4/20/05

The reason why the above occurs because the students believe the further
away they are from the teacher, the further away they are from
disipline. Unfortunately, this sometimes is the case

### 4/22/05

I have now observed several times Mrs. Dierking yelling at the students
and threating them. No respose.

### 4/25/05

I think that Mrs. Dierking should just do what she is threatening, just
to shake things up.

### 4/27/05

These kids are reminding me of me in middle school, only worse.
Frightening

### 4/29/05

I hope I don’t have to do a final writing/fragment assignment on this. Exempt if
possible.

### 5/2/05

What I have learned:

1.  The school system we have needs major revision
2.  Kids imposed in this system either do what they are told or find
    ways around it
3.  I am never going to teach people younger than me
4.  I am glad I am graduating this year
5.  The school system we have needs major revision
