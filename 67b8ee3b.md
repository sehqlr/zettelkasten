*A Comparison and Contradiction Study of Teachers: Dierking vs. Bertrand*

In accordance with the A+ class duties, I have gathered information on two teachers, their names being Dawnette Dierking and Kathy Bertrand. Although this paper is in fact very late in its completion, I hope that this rollick through their personal information will be to your liking, and to my academic achievement, this will be somewhat satisfactory. Let’s begin!

Our first discussion is on a background check of these two. Dierking (forgive the absence of formal title, I personally think this deduction will make it easier for all concerned) has a B.S. in Education and a B.S. in English at Missouri State University of Columbia and a Masters in Administration at Southwest Baptist University. Bertrand on the other hand has Bachelors degrees in English, Speech, and Drama; all of these degrees came from Central Methodist. Years of teaching: Dierking at less that 10, and Bertrand at much, much more that 10!

Our next point brings us to the actual classroom. Bertrand teaches several Speech classes (25-27 students) at the High School, and a single Drama class (18 students or so). Dierking teaches several English classes at the Middle School to monkeys of various ages (approximately 29 students). Bertrand’s class sizes and number of classes being taught give her much to do; she spends about 60-70 hours of meticulous rough-draft grading when her curriculum calls for it; her goal is to make sure her students excel. Dierking, on the other hand, lays claim to one hour per night.

Thirdly, let us discuss their in-school and extracurricular activities. Both teachers perform lunch duties and morning hall duties. Dierking is a Union Middle School Student Council Sponsor and holds the title “Professional Development Bldg Chair”. Bertrand is active in several vague “committees”.

Lastly, we will discuss their job status as of now. Both have said they enjoy working with the children they teach. Dierking specifically said she enjoys the literature she teaches. The two differed at what they didn’t like about their job. Dierking stated that she did not like any of the disciplining she has to do constantly. Bertrand dislikes budgetary concerns and other state regulations. They both have agreed on the big one: grading! On the big topic of ‘why would you ever think of going into that ghastly educating career?’ they offer the following advice: you must have a genuine interest in children’s education, helping them, sacrificing what you need to, and patience!

*Ye olde “The teacher who had the greatest impact on my life so far” essay*

Impact on my entire life thus far, eh? This is a tall order for me, because all of my teachers have made contributions, negative or positive in nature. I would tell you which teacher it was that finally taught me English…but I don’t remember. I could always try to remember that teacher who finally got me to be semiresponsible…but I can’t, because I ain’t yet. I suppose I should go with the one that I have spent the most time with during high school…

The two teachers that have had the most impact on me during my high school years have been Ralph Sellers and Doug Rice. These two teachers I almost spent too much time with. The reason why these two teachers have impacted my life besides the time spent is the things they have exposed me to. Rice, the band director, has obviously introduced me to a whole world of music, including Aaron Copeland, Bach, contemporary composers Brian Balmages and David Holsinger, and seventies rock group Blood, Sweat, and Tears. Sellers, the Drama sponsor, has shown me a great multitude of theatrical works, like *Don’t Tell Mother* by Monk Ferris. They both also have interesting philosophical views that I enjoy digressing upon.
