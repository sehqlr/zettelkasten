Chaucer Imitation: De casibus tragedies

*On Tiger Woods*

This Eldrick Tont, a Cablinasian son of Earl  
Of Woods, was ever born a golden golfer true  
With driver’s iron. Fortune then the wheel did whirl  
And catapulted Tiger topward. And he flew  
From baby’s halting first steps in toddler’s age  
To victory at every fairway came he to.  
In all the land on every sports mag writer’s page  
Proclaimed this truth. Fortune’s favor only grew.  
And all the honors poured upon this lordly man!  
From Nike, Titleist, the Hall of Fame, the grand  
Associated Press, as far as golf fans can  
Revere. This athlete’s name became a major brand,  
Yet Tiger his religion forgot. Reprimand  
This golfer Eldrick Tont, from truest faith did stray  
Because of great temptations, lust, and women. And  
Tiger’s place in Fortune’s grace was driven away.

*On Whitney Houston*

To Whitney Houston, diva, singer, balladeer.  
You promised you would always love us all!  
A preacher’s wife was bodyguarded here  
But all for naught. That Bobby Brown a husband call  
When living music artist life, consuming all  
Apocathery’s dregs like heroine and crack.  
His devil influence on you to sin, your fall  
Did cause. Repent; your bright career is out of wack.  

*On Bernie Madoff*

At Bernie Madoff businessman elite did make  
You rich, some multimillions, in penny shares  
On New York Stock Exchange. Investments you did take  
In honesty, or so they thought. With Fortune’s aires,  
In feinted worth you, Madoff, took us unawares  
With your philanthropy as front, you tried to sell  
A Ponzi scheme. Confessed your dealings to your heirs  
and now to penitence: you may not buy your cell.
