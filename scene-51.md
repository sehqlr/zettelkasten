It was while they were fixing waste extractors that Tobial and Grynt
were first discussing the terraforming circuits, when they discover some
weird happenings. Then they start on their quest to get more
information, to find out the discrepancies of the builds that they were
doing for the terraforming thing. At first, they think that it’s a fatal
design flaw, but the more evidence they gather, the more they realize
that it’s not a flaw, but rather the station is there for some more
nefarious purpose.

It takes them about three weeks to discover the truth about the station,
then they try to sabotage the work and Grynt gets caught and is
disappeared. That’s when Tobial starts to figure out that he needs to
get the information to the Rebellion as fast as possible.
