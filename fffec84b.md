They were the first ones to see the coming doom, and they were all for
it. They of course being the ones who also caused it. They were the
ender daemons, and they were just doing their jobs.

It was this world’s time. The celestial experiement had to end at some
point. But then, they got a notice to keep THIS one running. Why? No
answer. So they let it run. They kept getting conflicting reports from
beyond about when to end this experiment. Should it go now? No, let it
run for a few hundred more cycles. How about now? No, now it’s getting
interesting.

They decided to visit their experiment, noncorporeally of course. What
they found would astound those running the experiment, and those beyond
them. Their experiment had produced life, in multiple places. What would
happen when the life met itself?

When the first interlife war was declared, the experiment was deemed a
worthy failure, and the end of the first war was the end of the universe
it existed in.

Maybe next time this happens, it’d turn out differently?
