Space magic is something that I'd like to talk about now. I wonder what
all the implications are that I could explore with space magic. I know
that I really shouldn't try to explain everything, since that would be
trying to take the magic out of the magic, so that's going to be a
priority. I cannot explain everything in excruciating detail because
that will take away from the magic of it. I need to keep some things
entirely mysterious. But then again, they are in a school, where they
learn about magic, and that is something that I need to keep in mind too.
I have to have a universe that is consistent, or it falls apart in
critique. I need to have this stuff on lockdown, as it were. I think that
I will discover the right mix of mystery and explanation later on in
revisions.
