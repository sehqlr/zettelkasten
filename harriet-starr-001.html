attached segment zettel-content"><div class="pandoc"><h1 id="title-h1">harriet-starr-001</h1><p>Later, after detention ate right into her dinner, she finally managed a few crumbs. Well okay they weren’t actually crumbs; but they might as well be. She definitely had better meals than that. Actually, she was starting to really appreciate some of the meals she had here. Which scared her, because complaining about the food was a team sport at this school. Even those who didn’t have her magical talents, or her strength, could be equals when it came time to eat some of the horse slop they served here. At least, she had called it horse slop in the past. When she learned about food replication last semester, she had a different viewpoint of the cooks in the school. The meals were bland and blander; at least they were made to be that way, at least it was replicated by a computer. She assumed that the replicator food would taste worse, I mean, if it didn’t why would they be not using it all the way, all the time, you know? What she meant to think was, food replicators must be worse for children than hand-boiled soup every third day. Had to be, otherwise why would they underpay the kitchen staff to work their hands stiff making bread for the student body.</p><p>That was detention Harriet. Now we have to be dorm Harriet. Which is to say, quieter and less about sports statistics. It seems like none of her dorm mates had the brains for sports statistics. The only way that Harriet was getting though mathematics was through sports statistics. Physics was actually quite helpful in zero-g football, which is why she was finishing with extra good marks. Harriet was a single-minded person: if somehow a teacher could convince her that poetry of all things could relate to football; then maybe should would take an interest.</p><p>Which is part of the reason that dorm Harriet always talked about something else. Anything else. Seriously. Ven-tika would always be the first to disrupt rookie assessments in the league, to talk about something, oh, stupid like the Rebellion. Those scumbags don’t deserve discussion, yet Ven would want to talk about them. If she thinks that I have an obsession, she gives me a run for my credits.</p><p>Cyl Sapperstein was the first one to talk while they were making their beds. “What did you think of alchemistry, Ven?”</p><p>Ven looked at the ceiling with all three eyes. The fact that one of them was always looking just to the left of Harriet seems suspicious, at least to Harriet. But, no one will start that row. Best to listen to Cyl, she’s the best person to have bland conversations with, which is why she was friends with everybody. In such divisive times, wouldn’t it be nice to have someone as solid as Cyl? Plus, her blue skin and webbed ears were really a really nice change from all the other humans that lived in the school.</p><p>Exchange students were getting rarer and rarer these days. It must have something to do with the Rebellion, Harriet told herself. Probably something to do with them. Harriet was a lot of things, but she was not a hater. But she really didn’t like the Rebellion. Some of her classmates took it farther and, say that they would like to kill a rebel just to show them who’s really boss of the galaxy, us, that’s who. Harriet thought that went too far, she just wanted the Rebellion to stop killing people. Why don’t they just go back to where they come from?</p><p>Harriet would have written that in her diary, if she kept one. In lieu of that, she dug into the history book that she was supposed to have studied in detention but she just kept thinking about the injustice of the world. Obviously Professor Satti-Ding didn’t like her much, he has made that quite clear.</p><p>If she didn’t have the rotten luck of sitting in the front, where she was easily noticed, she might escape that class alive. Grades couldn’t enter it, she just had to survive. Maybe her parents would understand if she formed a, well frankly, bad opinion of history. Not only was Professor Satti-Ding the history teacher, he happened to be her father’s favorite teacher of all school. They were close. Close enough that Professor Satti-Ding’s opinion rubbed off on her father’s opinion of her.</p><p>Oh parents, how did she get along with them when she was younger? Harriet didn’t have a bad childhood, but it wasn’t without it’s difficulties. Her father’s opinion of her school work, for instance. He was a scholarly person. He valued what books said. Well, she valued what happened on the pitch. That’s where the real stuff happens. Things you can’t write down, you have to feel them in your body. That’s real, not things written down. Things written down are stupid. Stupid, stupid words. If she were any better at them, she’d be grateful, but she firmly believed that she could get through life without them. A lot of magic was done without words, the kind that was more about movements. That was what she was good at.</p><p>When magic was like dancing, Harriet Starr was better at it than anyone. Or at least, that’s what she firmly believed. A great many of Harriet’s beliefs were as solid as durasteel. She built her personality around her opinions and beliefs, but didn’t everyone do the same thing? Otherwise, how would people have a functioning society?</p><p>Things that were going on were starting to tell her that she was not exactly in a paradise though. Like, why didn’t anyone invent a better food replicator? Her mother would often tell her that was a silly question to ask when there were other things to worry about. But, like, Harriet was still a kid, you can’t expect a kid to have adult concerns. Not for another year any way. She was a senior in school, not a senior in a senior living center.</p></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2021-02-24T23:01"><a href="c954b8e6.html">Harriet Starr and the Space Conflict</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">harriet-starr</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">scene</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.20.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
