So, let me tell you about the school that Harriet goes to. It is called
the Calvary School for Intuitiionists, and it turns out to be a school
for mages that have the Intuition, which is the equivalent of the Force
in this universe. The Intuition is what gives someone sensitive to it
the power to see a little bit into the future, or have some greater
intuitive sense of mathematics or piloting, or what have you. Anytime
that someone has a mental ability that they cannot explain with magic,
they explain as the Intuition. Now, Harriet has the Intuition fairly
strongly, and thatâ€™s why she was especially sought out. Basically, this
school is like the Jedi Academy, where the Jedi kidnap children to raise
in their religion and their cutlish ways while they have space wizard
powers.
