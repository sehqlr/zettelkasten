raised attached segment zettel-content"><h1>scene-57</h1><div class="pandoc"><p>Harriet was starting to get worried about her exams coming up by the end of the year. She was not feeling well prepared. She seemed well prepared, what, three years ago was it? It must have been, that was the last time she did exams like this. When she was passing from Grade 9 to Grade 10. The school grading system had four school levels with three grade levels within, so Grades 1 - 3 are in the Early Childhood school, Grades 4 thru 6 are in the Elementary school, Grades 7 through 9 are in the middle school, and 10 through 12 were in the high school. Or, as they were known to the Imperial citizenry, Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary Schools.</p><p>There were many levels to school in the Empire, so they decided that you could go to as many levels as you like, assuming that you pass the previous levels. Between every level of school, there is an exam that is meant to evaluate you for passage to the next level of school. If you don’t pass, then you don’t get to advance to the next level. You must stay for another year, or drop out of school. The only really important school that everyone needs in the Empire is the Primary school. That’s the period when a child is taught how to be a person. Secondary school is for learning how to be a citizen of the Empire. The Tertiary school is for learning how to be responsible. And the Quaternary school is meant to teach you how to be professional. It is the level most people need to pass in order to hold the good jobs in the Empire. But, it is also a requirement for playing zero-g football professionally. They expect professionalism on the field, not the youthful exuberance of “school soccer.” They expect that you can pass Quaternary school. Unfortunately, Harriet had a problem. She had senioritis really bad. Like so bad that if she didn’t think anyone would kill her, she would not be watching this presentation on how to give presentations. She was bored, bored bored bored. She would rather be doing nearly anything else, but especially she would not mind running laps around the pitch if it meant she never had to hear about presentations ever again. However, if you want to go pro, you have to be a pro, and this presentation is teaching you how to be a professional. Plus, you can get someone to help you review this stuff later, when you are less obsessed with running laps.</p><p>Who is this?</p><p>Your inner professional, Harriet Starr. Your inner professional.</p><p>Harriet didn’t know what the levels after Quaternary school are. Probably something to do with knowledge and service to culture, or something like that. There was no way that she was going to do any of that kind of school. There was just no way. If this was supposed to be the professional level, how much worse could it get at higher levels? Would people really start to care about learning? One way that Harriet and a lot of her football mates was to make fun of learning at every moment they could.</p><p>Football was life, as far as Harriet and her footie mates were concerned. They didn’t care much about anything else. They cared about the songs. They cared about the kicks. They cared about the goals. But mostly they cared about each other, and that’s how it should be. The station was there’s, at least, any time they weren’t playing with a different team, that would come onto the station for their home games. The Cassiopeia Catfishes weren’t any kind of fierce fighting force, but they do love their football, and Harriet was the lead adherent to this odd little religion they found themselves in.</p><p>Football was live on the holovid. Harriet couldn’t keep her eyes away. She was so focused that her voice volume control which was usually on lockdown as far as Harriet was concerned, started to become uncontrolled. She ended up waking up three dorms when she squeed at Autok’s final kick into the inner circle. She woke up all those people, when eventually, she was told to shut the hell up, by all of her dorm mates. That was the time that Harriet decided that she was going to be quiet more often, because that was really embarrassing for her.</p><p>So, she was really interested in football. It was life, and it was the best. She only had one friend that wasn’t on the football team, and that was Saavitte. Saavitte was the only nerd that Harriet wanted to hang out with. It started as a tutoring relationship, but it became a good friendship that seemed like an old one but was actually quite new. They even thought they were in love for a short time, but they decided that wasn’t going to happen, they were better friends than lovers. (Does transitioning make people feel things like love for friends? Or is that complete horseshit? I’m really high right now.)</p><p>When they became good friends, Saavitte still helped with homework and things. That was still how they spent a lot of their time, studying.</p></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2021-02-24T15:18"><a href="539743d5.html">Harriet Starr and the Space Conflict</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2020-11-23T14:45"><a href="113a7ff2.html">Creative Writing Index</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;fiction/novels&#39;">fiction/novels</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;harriet-starr&#39;">harriet-starr</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.17.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
