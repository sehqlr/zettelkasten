Personal Notes
--------------

This was the first job Iâ€™ve ever had, and the longest held.

### Union MO Store

I remember being 18 and finally deciding that I could get a job at a gas
station, thereby dodging the fast food bullet, as I thought of it at the
time.

### Newtown MO Store

When I was working at the Newtown location, it was a real bad situation.
