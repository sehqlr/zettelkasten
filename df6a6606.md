# The Imaginary Friend

Once, the air tasted  
as we danced  
along the purple meadows  
of our youth, eating  
buttered toast. We held  
tea parties for my birthday,  
celebrating every Thursday  
just because we wanted to.  

Ever was I happy,  
the same of your eyes;  
azure, though the world  
was white and black. But  
soon tea cups to briefcases;  
more gray then less.  

Like an old photograph I  
faded too. You painted  
me over with granite  
rollers, my portrait  
now featureless wallpaper  
in a corner of your  
memory.  

Why must age  
choose monochromatic  
notes for its theme?  
Why must age  
utilize stark  
reality for color?  

Here lies myself  
buried beneath  
tax receipts  
hoping for the day when  
I may matter to you again.
