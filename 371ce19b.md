Scarlet Fire and Rain

By Samuel Hatfield

Just yesterday morning, or was it seven years agone?

Hester, your adulteress passion put an end to you

I walked into English class and I chose to write this song

I just hope I can put some sense in it

She’s been reviled and She’s seen pain

She’s endured suffering and people’s crap that might never end

I’ve lived times when Rodger Chillingworth was my friend

But I knew that I’d see the Scarlet Letter again

Won’t you look down upon me, Jesus

Curse me, the blackened sinner that I am

I’ve got punish myself and suffer through another day

My heart is aching and my chest has a brand

And I can’t ever make it go away

She’s been reviled and She’s seen pain

She’s endured suffering and people’s crap that might never end

I’ve lived times when Rodger Chillingworth was my friend

But I knew that I’d see the Scarlet Letter again

Been walking to an painful time, stood high upon the punishment scaffold

Lord knows when Hester Prynne shows it’ll turn my head around

Well, there’s hours of time in the forest sublime to talk about plans to escape to England

Sweet dreams and sailing machines and Pearl washing off a kiss

She’s been reviled and She’s seen pain

She’s endured suffering and people’s crap that might never end

I’ve lived times when Rodger Chillingworth was my friend

But I knew that I’d see the Scarlet Letter again
