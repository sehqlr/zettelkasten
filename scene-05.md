Chapter 5
=========







------------------------------------------------------------------------

They were getting high when the conversation just started about the vast
universe, and what even is morality, and about the terraforming unit,
and how it was so strange that all the spells that were inscribed in the
spell circuits are for Earth species exclusively? Why was there only
earth grasses, and microbiomes were also mostly Earth species, unless it
was proven that a different species was really that much better for
them. for the planets that they would be terraforming, right? Also, why
did the terraforming sometimes assume that the world had been devastated
by war, or some artificial disaster? Surely, you’d want to program in
some other contingencies, like if the planet had any existing life in
them. Like, any.

“The base assumption seems to be, that the world is habitable but barren
of all life? Or at least mostly? Devastated, I say. Devastated.”

“But, by what? What would do that sort of thing? Who would? Who would
assume planets fit for colonization would be devastated, as you said.
Devastated.”

“That would sorta, imply that there was something making those planets
devastated. A devastation engine?”

“You mean, you actually believe,”

“Yes, I know what you are thinking, but hear me out,”

"You honestly think, that this station is the devastation engine. That
rumor has been around for as long as the Empire has stood. There is no
such thing as as superweapon

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s go again,

go where?

Back to that conversation we were having before, when we were talking
about the purpose of the station? And you said that there was a
conspiracy?

Sure, if you want to call it that, yes, a conspiracy to commit genocide.
Perhaps many times? It’s serious. I know, it’s a serious accusation to
make against our government, but hear me out, okay?

No, I don’t want to talk about this with you because if we get caught,
we’ll be in really big trouble, like getting disappeared trouble, got
it? I want no part of it.

You must understand, I think it’s worth the risk

You must know nothing of risk if you think this is worth it

I don’t understand what is happening right now

I think that we are having an argument

Oh, I suppose that we are.

Do you want to stop having this discussion? Please, I really don’t want
to get into trouble with anyone. I have a family.

Yes, I am aware of your family, Tobial, you speak of them all the time,
really, I insist, I must talk to you about it, you are the main engineer
of this project, right? that means something to you. I know it does.
What you must understand, is that if I’m right, that you’ll understand
that this is strange to say, but that you aren’t the main engineer of
this project like you thought? What if, and hear me out, what if There
was an array of fire summoning crystals in the core of this ship, and
that crystal array was powered by uranium, and that there is no way that
anyone would need that much fire, unless they were trying to burn a
planet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

They were trying to talk about the same thing over and over. They keep
dodging, until Grynt confesses what he is thinking. Really, what he is
thinking, which ends up being right of course. That the ship has two
modes, a death mode and a life mode, and when those two were used
together, strategically it means that you can completely wipe out an
entire planet without completely destroying it. By converting into a
devastated planet. That means genocide. That means war crimes. that
means trials, and most certainly, hanging. We are not in a good place to
deny the truth. If the empire ever gets caught with this thing, we would
be exposed and that means accountability.

Accountability for our actions in intergalactic courts?

You mean, the space Hague?

Yes, that. Exactly. Space Hague.

There was a long pause between the two of them. Tobial seemed to be
preoccupied with the space Hague

space Hague?

Space Hague. Yes. Yes, yep.

Then, after that?

After, you want to know, what comes after? I will tell you what comes
after, the space prison, Space-caban. Spazz-caban. How ever you said,
say it, you are going to understand what I’m going to tell you, yes.
Space prison for space wizards. They drive you mad there, you know?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, we are in a tough spot here, we need to talk about this, think
about my family my family, we are talking here.

Yes, we are talking about that, yes, we are

Well, know what, I’m going to be blunt about this.

Oh really, you want to be blunt about this.

Yes, I. Do.

Go ahead then

Are we having an argument

Yes, of course we are, you were about to finally tell me the truth.

To be blunt, this ship and its crew will be committing war crimes if
this vessel is ever to be fully built. It may look like a space station,
it will eventually have to move from target to its next target. And that
makes it a vessel, which means that it has more restrictions on what it
can do according to intergalactic law. A space station has a “stand your
ground” clause that allows it to defend itself without much
ramification. That means that superweapons that stay put are not as
threatening. However, if they other side was not aware of the project,
then how does treaty apply, really, when you get down to the bones of
the matter. The bones of the matter is that this station, this *ship*,
is an engine of devastation, and it must be stopped, and i think that
you agree

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone knows how much they were going to get into trouble when they
started to do their sabotage. Well, not everyone. If anyone else found
out about this, they would be done with then and there. There was too
much risk in coordinating their efforts. The were not going to be in the
same cell. In fact, this was going to be there last conversation ever.
It is going to end in shouting because that is the only way that we are
going to get anywhere with this.

Tobial was always nervous, he was as nervous as when his son was born.
Tobial was going to betray his friend to the Empire, because that’s what
good citizens to when they are faced with this kind of threat to their
lives. That’s what he kept telling himself. He was going to be loyal to
his Empire. his countrymen, to humanity being the best species in the
galaxy, but yet, there was this persistent feeling that he was going to
have to abandon that as a lie, and have to accept that he was going to
have to go through with this after all. There was no way that he was
going to let this happen, was he? He wasn’t so sure anymore. Hm. He was
going to have this think this thing through, and he was going to have to
figure out, what exactly it means to betray someone. or something
greater than yourself. Is this how all traitors feel? So conflicted? Or
was it harder for him because of his level of patriotism. He was going
to see fit that no one deserves to go to the space Hague or however you
spell it, no one was going to deserve that kind of fate myself? Or that
of my family. He loved his family more than the empire, that was for
dammed sure. he was going to serve his family above all else. that was
the core of his identity. had he not make that clear?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The walk into the central core of the tower was enough to convince me
that my friend was right, and that there was a superweapon being built
on a mobile space station, which constitutes is as a vessel, and as
such, is subject to the Intergalactic War Accords? The laws that bind us
all, human or otherwise.

The Rebellion must make this mission it’s new priority. That space
station, that vessel, must be destroyed. sabotage was attempted and
partially successful. We have made the system vulnerable to attack from
a squadron of pilots., such as yourselves. we must destroy that station,
and soon. The core of the supserweapon also powers their defensive
systems, which means that we are going to have a hard time getting close
to that station. However, if we boarded that vessel with enough
officers, at key locations and times, that will allow us, the ability to
defeat the Empire, and exposing them for what they are. For we will
broadcast the entire battle to the outside realms. we will show them
that we are not going to die without a fight, and not without a cause.
We will fight for our right to not become war criminals without our
consent. We are here, to save the universe. Any questions?

man, sitting in this chair really does nothing for my back, you know? I
think my core muscles have weakened as I have grown older.

well, enough of that scene, lets move on to something else, lets say a
sex scene, oh, just kidding because I have no idea what trans sex is
like, or sex between aliens, or like, whether or not it actually adds
anything to the story, or whether or not I’m a pervert, all of these
things are all really good questions.

Hang on, did I admit that I’m a perv? God I’m high.

Hold on, I’m not really a pervert I don’t think. I seem to be writing a
character that seems like me but isn’t really.

then again, what if that’s how the mind is made, of many voices, and
that was an admission of guilt from that part of your brain.

New brain, who dis?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

alright, so there was this town that everyone lived in, right? They were
all terrorized by a giant scorpion god and they could not flee. They
could not defend themselves. they could not continue to live under the
terror. They could not.

then, an opportunity presented itself. They would sabotage the ship, and
if one of them were caught, the other promised to send word to the
Rebellion to make sure they were apprised of the situation here on the
station, and that they would come here and

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was such a thing as worrying too much but Tobial Bee wasn’t going
to let it bother him, not this time. He was going to complete the
mission, and nothing was going to stop him. At least, that’s what he was
anticipating doing. He wasn’t really sure.
