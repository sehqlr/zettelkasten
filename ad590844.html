Theodore figured that, more-than-likely, the legend was a corruption of historical fact: A long time ago, there was a mortal living in heresy of the common religion. The Heretic’s ideas were based on life with more fun and enjoyment in it, and the local religious leaders buried him alive, as a sign to those who had faith to repent, and those who (secretly) denied were desirous to remain (secret). Naturally, the name of the millennia-old crypt, Sanctum ut Lian, was also a derivative of the falsified narratives; when first built, it was probably called “For Liars, Non-Believers, and Losers —Vacancies”. From Theodore’s perspective, the ruse probably worked, for upon Sanctum’s floor was but a carpet of stone-dust, thick and heavy. The sudden footfalls on the ancient stonework seemed to awaken the crypt, and torches lit themselves as Theodore passed them by.</p><p>The scent of — no, there was no scent in the halls of masonry that Theodore could detect, even with his nostrils flared. Theodore wasn’t even aware of the torches’ smell; surely, if they burned, the organics and ashes would be a dead giveaway. Theodore reached out to touch the torch, and realized quickly that the torch wasn’t really there. His hand passed through it, much like a hologram projection.</p><p>“Show me what you really are.”</p><p>The torches were no more, and suddenly, the walls themselves emitted light. Nothing else in the entire of his life perplexed Theodore more than that sensation of ubiquitous light (that new record, of course, is going to be quickly broken again, several times over). That sort of technology wasn’t readily available on Hy, and he wondered what the torches were for. On second thought, he didn’t know how the walls knew what he was saying; how they responded so quickly. Theodore moved all-the-more swiftly through the newly, mentally dubbed “Sanctum ut Creepy”, and in a downward direction. After an approximate ten minutes, Theodore reached a wide, heavy door. With undue haste, the door was sliced asunder by the Xr-sword, and fell two pieces.</p><p>The room the door was meant to protect was more of a hexagonal hub, with hex corridors. In the middle was a nice tea table, with some odd liquids in glass vials upon it. There were some chairs, but they went unoccupied (one was noticeably apart from the others). Only then did Theodore notice that the door was in the ceiling of the room, and that he was breaking every single gravitational law that he knew of: there he was standing on the hallway floor which is now a wall and facing a wall-now-floor (with the tea table conveniently sticking to the surface at the wrong angle) and Theodore’s head was spinning in circles and triangles and amorphous-shaped outlines…</p><p>Theodore was now in the hexagonal room, with the remains of a chair splintered all around him. Theodore utilized his memory in “What-the-hell-happened?” mode, and remembered: walking to the edge of the hallway he was in, sat down, draped his legs over the edge (like a kid at a dock), feeling his sense of balance overwhelmed, and……</p><p>Theodore picked himself up, and started removing wooden bits from his chest.</p><p>The room had a dome. Besides that, everything else that Theodore saw was the same: the chairs, the tea table, the vials, and the corridors. The last corridor he looked at wasn’t like the others — the name “Lian” was engraved upon the overhanging arch.</p><p>The legends didn’t gain more credence in Theodore’s mind, however; it seemed that Lian was either the name of the Heretic, or that the word itself held that meaning. Sheathing his Xr-sword, Theodore marched on, convinced that he wouldn’t find anything more that a pile of dust.</p><p>Yet another door greeted Theodore, but this time, it was a far greater material, truly worthy of holding prisoners. Double-checking with the Moleculator, Theodore surmised that this was the most expertly alloyed-Yekite Theodore ever encountered. Most of the time, the Yekite-base is mixed with several different materials to reach the necessary 50% ratio; but this was mixed with pure Sylocate, and the result was beautiful.</p><p>“Too bad.”</p><p>Theodore flashed his trusty Xr-sword again, and again, and again, until the door fell too many pieces. Entering the room, Theodore saw exactly what he was expecting: a pile of dust. More like a mound, really. Theodore started dusting, no, digging through the mound, looking for that fabled Book that the Group wanted so much, when…</p><p>“A visitor, eh?”</p><p>Theodore jumped, and whirled around to find the source of the sudden disturbance.</p><p>“I’m not supposed to have visitors.”</p><p>The voice…was from the mound. Theodore watched in horror, as a skeletal figure emerged from the shifting dirt, and gave himself a good shake. Theodore would have choked to death, if the dust wasn’t as heavy as lead. The prisoner towered over Theodore’s diminutive size, although he didn’t seem to have any flesh. His eyes didn’t say one color, either; a constant shifting of hues and shades. He was very…unnatural.</p><p>“I am Lian”</p><p>“I am called Theodore”</p><p>“Called? Interesting way of putting it…”</p><p>“You’re staring at me.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“I find it disturbing.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“I want to know the motive.”</p><p>“You are Human.”</p><p>“I realize that! Let’s move on to more significant matters!”</p><p>“That is significant, Theodore-Human.”</p><p>“Why?!”</p><p>“Because, I was built by Humans.”</p><p>“How do you mean, Lian?”</p><p>“I am officially 2,379 years old, however, I was being planned and built for an additional 121 years prior.”</p><p>“So, you’re twenty-five hundred years old?”</p><p>“I suppose. But that is beside the point. My age has not diminished my purpose.”</p><p>“And what is that, oh Lian?”</p><p>“Storytelling.”</p><p>“Storytelling for whom?”</p><p>“Humans.”</p><p>“Humans…had history?”</p><p>“Why yes, Theodore-Human. They were once the Lords of the Universe.”</p><p>“Narrative of the Origin” as told by Lian, Storyteller.</p><p>“At the start of the Galaxy’s history, most planets that had the capacity for life were populated by Sentient creatures. These Sentients were created with perfect form for their kind; any defect that they had within their heredity had a negative consequence, and they would perish without question. These people formed nearly perfect societies, with deviants forming only in times of great peril, and these only removed themselves. All the peoples of the Galaxy were content, and there was no need for anything else.</p><p>Now, far away from all of its brothers was a Sentient world that didn’t follow that pattern. From this world came the Humans.</p><p>The First Human didn’t have a name, as most First beings. As he divided unto himself, he began to wonder: If I am perfection, then why must I divide unto myself? Should not my descendants be greater than I? He reasoned that mistakes can beneficial to a system. He then devised a plan to improve upon himself: evolution.</p><p>So, as Humans continued to multiply and spread, the Spirit of the First started to encourage his descendents to make war upon themselves; to quarrel, and cheat, and steal, and many other things that Humans had to devise new words for. At the cost of blood, the genetics of Humanity began to improve, much to the delight of the Spirit of the First.</p><p>In efforts to please the will of their First, Humanity began to create technology, and shaping the fate of the world about them. Technology was a truly unexpected progression of events, and the Spirit of the First gave his idea much credence.</p><p>And thus, the entire of Human history can be explained.</p><p>Millennia passed, and Humanity became great in their exploits; they could bend reality to their will, and each lived, for ages, by the Universal Principals. They had named all the stars, and they had mapped the entire of the Galaxy from beginning to end.</p><p>It was at this time that Humanity decided to colonize other parts of the Galaxy. So, they built self-automated machines to explore for them, and to build Gateways to suitable planets. With time, Humanity had conquered most of the Spiral Arm, and started to find the Sentient planets closer to the Core. When Humans found the multitudes of ‘perfect Sentients’ indigenous to these planets, they were expecting societies of much greater technology then they themselves. But as they discovered, much to their dismay, perfect societies don’t improve. This made the Spirit of the First perplexed: Had only he wanted the betterment of his people? Where all others so content with their existence that they did not want their children to be greater then themselves? The Spirit of the First was disappointed, and thus the unfortunate ‘Enslavement of the Ignorant’ began.</p><p>“’Enslavement of the Ignorant’? How do you mean, Lian?”</p><p>“The Humans, in accordance with their First, believed that technology was the measure of a civilization’s worth.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“Because the Humans believed that all other Sentients were ‘ignorant’ of their state of ‘shame’, they decided to rule over them, and hopefully ‘cure’ them of their horrid ‘disease’.</p><p>“So they…enslaved them.”</p><p>“Correct, Theodore. Now, we enter into the part of the story that relates to you”</p><p>“After a short time, and with very little effort, the Humans conquered all the Sentient worlds, and formed the Twelve Imperial Districts, with accordance to their sacred number. Within these Districts, all ‘Ignoramus” Sentients were to work in factories, mines, and agricultural centers, and were forced to learn Human technology. At a cost of great hosts, Sentients became experts at it.</p><p>Unfortunately for Humanity, they had forgotten their own history, and overlooked the possibility of rebellion.</p><p>One day, a Sentient known as Versoth was working in ‘defense research’, testing a new kind of electromagnetic-based weapon. He was choosing to be whipped instead of pulling triggers, when it occurred to him that Humans weren’t gods, and that they can die. He decided to test his theory, and wound up with five dead Imperial Officers at his feet.</p><p>Thusly, the War on Humanity began, and ended almost as quickly. Although Humans were in more protected areas, the Gateways that had created the Galactic Web facilitated the almost immediate generation of the Grand Sentient Army, and they killed almost all Humans that they found.</p><p>The Humans that were left to live suffered immense persecution, as punishment for their arrogance. They were treated with more cruelty than that of the Humans toward their slaves. This is understandable, yet that didn’t change the fact that Humanity was reduced to ashes. The newly-formed Galactic Council debated about boiling Earth; instead, they space-locked it, and disallowed any ship or Gateway to become active.</p><p>Although Humans have survived all of this, they are still put below their true value. I, along with the eleven of my brethren, staged a campaign for Human rights. Those were lies, of course, and that is why I am in this Sanctum-prison, and my brothers are gone, to seek other histories to record, and other stories to tell.</p><p>“So, are you telling me that I am an outcast because some of my ancestors were bastards who didn’t like content people?! I thought I was ostracized for <strong>good</strong> reasons, like having six fingers, or being afraid of sunlight.”</p><p>“I am soory, but that is how it goes, Theodore. You, however, are quite interesting, compared to others of your kind.”</p><p>“How do you mean, oh Lian? And why are you staring at me again? This is a terrible habit you have.”</p><p>“I apologize. I am interested in the evolutionary path your biology has taken. I you would allow me a moment of observation?</p><p>“I suppose”</p><p>“Well, you are an albino, and you have cyan eyes. That allele doesn’t even really exist in the Human genome.”</p><p>“That is your analysis?”</p><p>“There is also the fact that you are growing at an even less accelerated rate than that of my creators. That means you have mutated a few more years unto your life.”</p><p>“And?!”</p><p>“Your brain wave output is of a far higher amplitude that average, but that has happened quite a bit in Human heredity; however, yours seems to be of an entirely different energy signature that that of any other that I know.”</p><p>“You have said a mouthful, Lian. And I still don’t understand.”</p><p>“You, Theodore, are an active mutant.”</p><hr /><p>In the Sanctum room stood the two outcasts: Lian and Theodore. Lian waited patiently for Theodore to respond to his last comment and discovery. Theodore took a long time; but Lian has waited for longer than that.</p><p>“Lian, how do you mean, ‘active mutant’?”</p><p>“Well, it means that your body is constantly manufacturing new mutations.”</p><p>“How could I remain as I am if I am constantly mutating?”</p><p>“Of course, this sort of thing is usually only theorized about. I have never even given thought to what a real one would be like.”</p><p>“And?!?”</p><p>“It seems…that these new mutations are usually meaningless, and your body discards them. Out the few that you make to begin with, most aren’t used. However, when one is used, the mutation is immediately shared amoung all your cells; not just in the initial cell. The mutation usually spurs only a small change, like a slight structural improvement within your muscles, or a slight improvement upon your eyesight—things as such. It is my personal belief that the active mutant cannot happen randomly, and it is of an outside sphere of influence.”</p><p>“What if there was a big thing? What would happen to me?!</p><p>“Well, I suppose if you developed a more radical mutation, your body would slowly change to the new configuration. I don’t think that it would be discomforting in any fashion, I mean, after all—it is your body.”</p><p>“Lian, all your stories are incredible beyond any fantasy I have ever heard, but how am I supposed to even believe anything you have said?! You might have made up this entire story with that wonderfully mechanical brain you have, and you might be fooling me into blindness!”</p><p>“What proof do you require that what I tell you is factual?”</p><p>“I don’t know!!”</p><p>With this, Lian raised his hand, and put it near Theodore’s face, to allow him to see. Theodore noticed the hand’s configuration, look at his own, and almost wanted to cry.</p><p>The two, organic and mechanical, both had six fingers. For the first time in his life, Theodore found another being that had six fingers like his own.</p></div><div class="metadata"><div class="date" title="Zettel date"><time datetime="2020-11-24T14:01">2020-11-24</time></div></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2020-11-11T19:51"><a href="050f356a.html">Novels</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;age/highschool&#39;">age/highschool</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;writing/novels/theodore-melliah&#39;">writing/novels/theodore-melliah</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.10.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
