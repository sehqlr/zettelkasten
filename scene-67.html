raised attached segment zettel-content"><h1>scene-67</h1><div class="pandoc"><p>The space battle was raging through space, dangerous spells wizzing back and forth across the deep darkness of space. Not even the stars were outshining the magic energy taking place here, and even though there is no sound in space, you can just imagine what a holovid would do to make it sound really epic. There was no telling just how many people were going to die, but it was probably going to be a lot. You see, space battles aren’t like naval battles, which is what the most popular holovids show. No, it is complete zero-g football madness fighting in space. It was all angles and trajectories, and if you messed up, you were out of the game entirely. Small comfort for Harriet, who was currently riding in one of these death traps. She thought that she would never get out of school alive some days, but that was just silly. Here, she could actually die. It wasn’t a joke anymore. But that didn’t stop her from making them.</p><p>“So, what are our chances, Nall? Slim to none? I don’t much like those odds, but I’m sure you face them all the time, right? You and your daring do, or whatever phrasology that you’d use for this kind of moment?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, it’ll do you no good. Really, don’t think about how you are going to die on these kinds of missions. Just focus on doing your job.”</p><p>“But my job is to wait in here until we crash into a space station, how am I not supposed to worry about dying when crashing comes into it?”</p><p>“You do have another job; you are going to have to be my second pilot,” Q’nall looked over his shoulder and winked at Harriet, “You are going to have to perform repairs while in flight. That’s what the android would do if they were here.”</p><p>“I don’t know how to fix a ship, let alone fly one!”</p><p>“Well, then, I guess we are going to have to trust that I won’t be indisposed while we take our flight.”</p><p>As they were going through preflight checks, Harriet began to be aware of a soft sound in her head. Something soothing, something to make her feel more relaxed. she couldn’t figure out why. Maybe someone was trying to tell her something from a distance; she knew that was something that could happen to a Force user, like her. She still couldn’t believe that she was a Force user sometimes. She just thought she was an ordinary magic user. I mean, don’t get her wrong, she was a pretty okay magic user, but she never thought she was really special at it. She thought that she was going to be special because of football, not for being space psychic. That was an odd way to put it, but giving things little nicknames was a way to cope. Didn’t everyone do that? Anyway, she decided to listen to the soothing not-sound and not worry about if it meant anything. She just let her body relax through the rest of the preflight check, which took about 20 minutes from her estimation, but emotionally it was 3 hours.</p><p>When they were finally ready, Q’nall turned to Harriet again. “Ready?” he asked.</p><p>After a moment, Harriet replied, “Ready and waiting, sir.”</p><p>The way that spacecraft worked in this universe is that there’s a magic spell that removes the effects of gravity on the ship, and then there’s a combustion engine that generates a thrust out of the back of the ship. Because of the contragravity spell, it doesn’t take much push to get a ship off the ground and into the air. It does take a great deal of thrust to make the ships go, but the fuel that they use is used up entirely, without extra emissions beyond what you need to get a jet effect going. The GRQ-11 was designed to last for a week outside of a ship, so the fuel tank was huge. The fuel that they used for their fighters wasn’t flammable until used in the thrust spell circuit, so the ships wouldn’t usually explode horribly once they were downed. Which was a good thing for the Rebellion, since they were shot out of the sky quite a lot. And hitting someone’s ejection pod was really difficult when it was designed to fly around erratically after ejection. That meant that most of the enemy ships would do the same thing, but they tended to explode more. They weren’t designed to save life, they were designed to be fast, so their fuel was a bit more volatile. That gave their ships a speed advantage, but they were also more fragile. The other thing about Imperial ships is that they were too specialized, whereas the Rebellion ships were more generalist. Nearly everyone flew the GRQ-11 in the Rebellion, but in the Armada, you flew about a half-dozen ships in any given fleet: interceptors, bombers, tugboats, you name it, it probably is in there somewhere. There were even special ships for landing ground troops, while the Rebellion generally used their big ships to transport both troops and ships. Although there wasn’t much troop movement these days. Most of the forces left in the Rebellion were dedicated to the different squads that made up their armada of sorts. And Delta Squadron was the best squadron, hands down and feet up, as Eenee would say.</p></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2021-02-24T15:18"><a href="539743d5.html">Harriet Starr and the Space Conflict</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2020-11-23T14:45"><a href="113a7ff2.html">Creative Writing Index</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;fiction/novels&#39;">fiction/novels</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;harriet-starr&#39;">harriet-starr</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.17.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
