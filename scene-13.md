Chapter 13
==========

So, are there computers in the magical space future we find ourselves
in? I believe so, but it's complicated. You see, because conventional
computers were definitely invented before the unveiling, they were most
definitely introduced into magical society. However, the improvement
that magic could bring to computers was true artificial intelligence.

Because magic is able to imbue basic intelligence with inanimate
objects, computers can have some intelligence imbued into them (that's
how we have androids after all). So, a lot of practically impossible
problems were solved by magic, but not all the classically hard
problems. Like, magic couldn't solve NP=P, because with magic, you
cannot be completely certain of your results, so computer scientists
weren't able to truly solve it. However, a lot of new algorithm were
possible with magic. Some problems are still better suited by being
solved with quantum chips, but those are a part of classical systems,
not supplanted by them.
