So, that's how the story begins, but how does it end? With Harriet
standing on the observation deck of a ship staring at a milky way
galaxy? I don't think I'll be that much of a thief. I think that I'll
have the ending be with Harriet and Q'nall looking into each other's
eyes. That seems right to me. And holding hands. In the rebel
encampment. Under the stars, yeah, that's how I'll get that reference
in, they will be under the stars planetside, lying down in the grass
looking up. That sounds really nice actually, so that's what I'll do.
