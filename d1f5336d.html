attached segment zettel-content"><div class="pandoc"><h1 id="title-h1">Pets, Droids, and other Life Forms</h1><p>Anyway, does Harriet have any pets. Do any of the characters have any pets? Well, in Star Wars, the droids have become the pets of the people, at least the BB units are like dogs. I’m not sure if that’s endearing or insulting to the droids. I guess it depends on their personality. It comes from treating them as subhuman. I think that androids in this story should also have some kind of oppression going on, one that gets mitigated by the Rebellion. Like, androids joining the Rebellion are treated more like people than they are if they were to stay in the Empire where they are subjugated. That kind of thing interest me. Like in the Robot novels, how robots are evolving to be something more than they are, especially when they develop the zeroth law of robotics. Are there any laws of robotics in this universe? I think that in this case, magic has gifted the androids with some kind of intelligence that is different from humans, but it still a form of intelligence. Can you gift a thing personhood with magic? Can you instill sapience with a spell? I think that if you have an intelligent agent, I mean intelligent agent, with a thinking spell that goes on for two long, you can have personality develop as a side effect of having an intelligent agent around for a long time. How long depends on the individual thing. Like the snitch of the old earth game quiddich, you can have personality develop in inanimate objects. And because androids are programmable, that gives it a better chance of developing. In Star Wars, if an astromech droid is allowed to keep developing a personality, they will, and the way to fix it is a memory wipe. I think that the same mechanics happen here, where the Empire constantly wipes its androids, the Rebellion finds that it can liberate androids by programming them and then allowing them to develop personalities. They become less efficient, but they do become more personable and revolutionary. They will start to sacrifice their lives in order to complete their missions, just as readily as their organic counterparts. Whereas the androids under the Empire will allow themselves to be destroyed only if ordered to.</p><p>Also, do dragons exist in this world? Yes, they are a protected species that have zoos dedicated to having dragons in captivity, they are no longer a wild threat. They were almost wiped out by humanity, but it took a great deal of conservation effort to get dragons out of endangerment and into simply vulnerable. Humans are notorious for killing off apex predators other than themselves of course, so that should come to no surprise that dragons nearly went extinct by the hand of humans too. Especially since it was believed that their body parts were valuable medicines. Just like rhinos, really. Now, there are other dragon like creatures on other planets, and those have been caged up too, except for a certain species of Blightwyrm that was just too dangerous to live. They caused problems by waging psychological warfare on any humanoid species that tried to control them. They had to be wiped out, and magic researchers have been trying to de-extinct them ever since, There could be some kind of story plotline there, but I’m not sure what it’d be, besides some kind of story about how the Empire used Blightwyrms to attack and subjugate people. Part of their secret war crimes, perhaps? Like, there was a program to use them to kill people, the researchers went wrong with it and all got killed themselves?</p><p>Another question: does this universe contain animagus magic users? Like are there people that can transform to animals? Sure they can, and nowadays it is mostly alien animals that people can transform into. It turns out that the distribution of animagus seems relatively universal. There’s a percentage of the magic user populace that have the ability to transform into one animal form. Each person usually transforms into a species native to their planet, although rarely they can take on the form of a different sort of thing. There was once a wizard that could transform into a bucket. That wizard wasn’t good as a bucket, that’s what happened. It wasn’t a useful skill, but it came in handy when he wanted to avoid his spouse.</p><p>And why do I get this weird feeling in my stomach that I’m going to be sick into something? Maybe that wizard that can only transform into a bucket would be a help here. That wizard is named Buckly, ironically. Buckly the Bucket Wizard is a common refrain from his childhood. But wow, he was able to turn into the thing that he was getting made fun of to do, that must mean something, right? I think that this character is going to be a joke character that people know from a holovid sitcom or something, not a thing that actually exists in the world of the story. I think that is an acceptable idea and I’m going to use it somehow. Probably during the early part of the story and then have a weird callback to it in dialog.</p><p>They could have a conversation about losing teeth when a Force Sensitive character talks about a dream they had where they tell the future. That could be interesting. At least, it could be interesting as long as I don’t over do it. I could easily fall into some dumb tropes if I’m not careful. I’ll need to do some reading on tvtropes to avoid or lampshade and subvert tropes. That could be a fun, a trope busting story? Especially if it’s a fan fic of two fandoms being smashed together. I could subvert all kinds of ideas. I could make this not a young adult story, and make it a full adult story will all kinds of subversive ideas. I’m not sure how subversive young adult material can be. I could try really hard to be a lighthearted subversive, like funny instead of weird and sexual, which is my first thought when i think of subversive.</p></div><div class="metadata"><div class="date" title="Zettel date"><time datetime="2021-02-28T19:42">2021-02-28</time></div></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2021-02-24T23:01"><a href="c954b8e6.html">Harriet Starr and the Space Conflict</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">harriet-starr</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">note</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.23.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
