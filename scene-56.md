So, there are the Sith, are there any other organizations that the
readers should know about? Well, if there are ninjas, there have to be
pirates, right? So, what kind of piracy happens in space. Space pirates,
space pirate kind of piracy happens in space. So, what are they like?
Well, do you remember that movie Treasure Planet? Well, like that but
grittier and less dog- and cat- people having babies. They were also
kinda cyberpunk, because they commit holonet crime too, can’t do
everything by hijacking space barges, that’s slow work and you can keep
committing crime while you wait for ships to pass by. They also have
aliens in their crews, because of the oppression and how space piracy is
a high-risk proposition, so they take in all kinds as long as you are
loyal and don’t get any friends killed, you can join a ship. And you
know that they smoke weed on those ships, while they are singing their
space piracy songs. It’s jolly, because that’s what pop culture expects
from pirates; jolliness. Joviality. Laughter. And other positive
emotions that don’t really enter a criminal lifestyle that much anymore.
Not if you watch the more gritty crime shows that is. Not much laughter
there.
