# Zombification and True Love

My love hungers after me,  
to Sally I’ll always return.  
“Stolen, my Heart!” Freely  
we love each other; I and she  
gouge ourselves, each in turn  
Our love hungers after we!  

Now, from the undead we try to flee;  
for safety we truly yearn,  
“Swollen, my Heart!” Free  
from the undead I wish to be.  
Sally got attacked! Now I learn  
my love’s hunger’s after me!  

I’m being attacked by my dear, sweet Sally  
the blood pours as from a cistern.  
Stolen, my Heart! Free  
from my ribcage as an osprey.  
Is it that bad? Pain no longer burn;  
My love, hunger is after me  
Steal a heart, dinner’s free!
