My arms are getting tired from typing for long periods of time because I
have to keep them suspended above the keyboard. Maybe this is something
that I need to do as a typist and just develop those muscles. We'll see
what happens, but I'm going to need frequent breaks until I get the
better desk up here. That will be priority tomorrow. If I win tonight,
which I intend to do, I'm going to slow down on writing and make sure
that I'm comfortable while doing it, because I plan on doing much more
of it moving forward. I think that I want more tea, my stomach is upset
and that ginger in the spiced chai was helping. I think that I'm going
to want to start eating ginger candy or something if my stomach is going
to be upset all the time. Thanks body, you suck.

I had to adjust my headphones to make my ears curl in a bit so they
don't have any pressure on them. Do they fix headphones in the future?
Like a magic spell that makes them perfectly adjusted to your head.

Do you think that magical products come with spells in the instructions.
that would be somewhat interesting. Like the headphones adjustment
spell is included with purchase, and it just lets you do it even though
you never even knew the spell existed in the first place. In fact, I
think that I want a scene with Harriet getting new headphones in it just
so I can explore that idea.
