Chapter 12
==========

This is going to be yet another dispatch from the holonews desk, Q'nall
told himself. This was just going to be just another dispatch. There was
no telling how long that it was going to be before another one. News has
been coming out of the Imperial News Desk rather slowly these days. And
increasingly, they are just getting bizarre. Things like, not reporting
on that disastrous harvest on Trekalia, or that one of their
administration officials just quit over corruption charges.
