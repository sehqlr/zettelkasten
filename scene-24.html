segment zettel-content"><h1>scene-24</h1><div class="pandoc"><p>The GRQ-117 was the most impressive ship that Q’nall had ever seen. It was a thing of derelict beauty, industrial grace, and some of dumpster chic as well. Whatever you said about the GRQ, it was a good ship with some interesting features. The main new feature was the partial heads up display in the helmet: theoretically it could make sure that you knew where you were no matter what direction you were going, and it had some builtin damage resistant spells to make it extra durable. The sigils in the heads up display were a little different, since they weren’t on the usual glass surface that adorns most magitech computer systems. This display was made of paper, and it still glowed with sigils, just more dimly. But you didn’t need to focus on them too much; they were close to your eyes and adjusted themselves accordingly. The main information that the mini heads up display had was that it showed your speed, and where your target was in relation to where you were looking. That means that if you followed your target with your eyes, you were able to see the information about them without looking down, like you had to with the traditional heads up display that was installed in the GRT series. This should make combat snappier, Q’nall told himself, this should come in handy in space battles, especially if you take some damage while you were going hunting.</p><p>Going hunting. Is that such a good euphemism for killing? Q’nall was still pretty young compared to some of the older officers, but really, a bit older than some of the fresh recruits. Most of the people in the Rebellion was the result of conquests that had been made in the last 10 years. The Empire was in an expansionist phase; maybe they slow down before they destroy too many more worlds. Or stopped forever, entirely. Q’nall didn’t think that the Empire could ever fall, but then again, there were all kinds of historical instances of institutions like Empires falling quickly after some crisis point. Was the Rebellion that crisis point? Was Q’nall a special member of a special group that will permanently change history forever? Will he be a footnote in some text? He couldn’t hope for that much credit. Just the fact that the Empire had been stopped invading Datyl was enough for him. He was glad that he wasn’t apart of the mission, because almost everyone was either captured or killed, but the Rebellion bought the Datyllians enough time to repair their planetary shielding that stopped the invasion by denying the ground troops ground to land on. And, since the planetary shield was up, that meant that the Rebellion could apparate out of there and leave the Datyllians a chance to fight on their own. The Imperial Armada fleet was pretty broken up at that point, and couldn’t defend against the planetary defense systems anymore. They were defeated, but it seems that was the brightest moment in the Rebellion’s history. Ever since then, the Rebellion had been on the run, resupplying from sympathizers as much as possible, but mostly, just camping out on border planets, hunting their own food, fighting skirmishes that were increasingly bloody, and all in all, just having a really shitty time about it.</p><p>Q’nall had joined somewhat early in the Rebellion’s history, but not during that initial conflict. He had been an Imperial ensign, fresh from the local Academy branch on Fillandtite, and still closeted. Still having to disguise who he was to everyone. Things used to be better: there were laws against discrimination. But the political winds had begun to change, ever since the Empire had expanded to double it’s original size just a hundred years ago. In that time, the government had become more repressive, and started to curtail certain rights officially, and ignore a few more basic ones routinely.</p><p>The fact is that Q’nall was a part of a whisper network of people that had survived into this increasing dark time. A whisper network that circulated the crimes that the Empire was starting to commit. It was all the new Empresses’ fault. She had spearheaded a lot of the new initiatives, and was convinced that the Empire had to expand or die. She made speeches about how the economy was stagnant and how it needed new markets or was going to collapse under it’s own weight, and that would mean starvation or worse for the average citizen. Lots of scare tactics. And the thing is, the human race had seen this sort of thing before. It had just been so long that most people had forgotten their ancient history lessons. Huh. I suppose that if the Empire employed more classicists, this thing probably wouldn’t happen. At least, that’s what Q’nall kept telling himself.</p><p>Anyway, the GRQ-117 was a hunk of junk, but he loved his. It even came with a little repair android. It looked like a child, but it didn’t speak, at least, not in a language that he could understand. He was told that the language was Robotic, and that it took magitechnitions years to understand it, and even longer to speak it. It was interesting, they said. No one had actually written it, it just sort of evolved among the androids that were human shaped but weren’t equipped with a vocalizer spell.</p><p>Q’nall would have to contemplate this later, as there was a mission coming up – he was going to be assigned to protect a convoy of ships. That convoy must get through, no matter what, which is why Delta Squadron was going to get in there. They were the squadron you wanted if you wanted something to change. Usually for the better, although they were pretty loose with the term “better.” Most of the time they were there to clean up some mess that someone had made. They were adaptable, and they were all good pilots. The Rebellion couldn’t do much better than Delta Squadron, although they couldn’t do much better anyway.</p><p>Q’nall was the most junior member of the Squadron, which meant that he got to do all the “best” jobs. Like flying out of a dangerous situation first, so that he wouldn’t get hurt. That was patronizing to him, although he was grateful that he didn’t die all those times. OK, not patronizing, but pretty close. If he were immature, which he only is sometimes when he feels like it</p></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2021-02-24T15:18"><a href="539743d5.html">Harriet Starr and the Space Conflict</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;fiction/novels&#39;">fiction/novels</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;harriet-starr&#39;">harriet-starr</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.17.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
