attached segment zettel-content"><div class="pandoc"><h1 id="title-h1">scene-65</h1><p>There was nothing greater than a food replicator that actually worked. The way that it worked is that you put in a credit chip, and then it would listen to your food order and magic it into existence. You then would open the little hatch to see exactly what you wanted, well, based on what you said anyway. There was a way to enter your own food spells, but Harriet never bothered. The regular food that came out of the little dumbwaiters were quite good, although never as good as home cooking. She would think about her father’s home cooking often. He was nearly a professional chef in her book, and she never ate a meal that wasn’t cooked from scratch at home. Ah, home. Was there anyway that she was going to see her home again? Or was it going to be living in the mud with these other rebels for the rest of her life. Hm. Maybe she should start an association, or even a league, for the Rebellion? She could do something to the dumb rules that the Leagues had put into place, and add in some new ones that would make the game more fun. That was something to think about while eating this spaghetti, she thought to herself. Yes, space spaghetti with space meatballs (actually, they weren’t space meat, it was normal everyday Arturian beef). With black noodles. Her favorite.</p><p>As she grabbed the plate out of the replicator, she saw Eenee eating by herself in the mess hall. Harriet decided to go talk to her. After all, she was going to have to make new friends, right?</p><p>“Hey,” Harriet said as she approached the table, “this seat taken?”</p><p>“Not at all, pull up a chair,” Eenee said, gesturing to the empty spot right across from her. As Harriet laid her tray down on the table, she looked at the black spaghetti and said, “I’ve never seen a meal like that before, what is it?”</p><p>“Black Spaghetti, with white sauce and Arturian meatballs,” Harriet said, “It reminds me of home. My father used to make this for me all the time, completely from scratch. It became my favorite meal to get from the replimat at the school cafeteria. They don’t do Arturian meatballs there, they say that it’s too expensive to get fresh. So I’ve made due with replicated stuff.”</p><p>“Interesting. I’d say that they can’t get Arturian beef is because it’s quite pricey. How did your family afford it?”</p><p>“A lot of my family’s income went into getting quality ingredients for my father. He is practically a professional chef, but he never managed to get something out of his kitchen and onto other people’s plates for money. My grandmother called him a failure behind his back, but he never failed me. He was always there for me.” Harriet started to tear up at the thought of never seeing him again. That thought would not leave her mind. There wasn’t any soft voice of the Force helping her feel better this time either. Sheesh, why was there this tension about her family all of the sudden.</p><p>She looked across the room to Tobial, who was also eating alone, but he was fixating on his plate, and not inviting anyone to join him.</p><p>“Don’t bother,” Eenee said to her. “I tried to socialize with him earlier but he’s not interested. I think that he is having trouble adjusting to the new lifestyle he’s chosen for himself.”</p><p>“I think that he’s just missing someone. You know how he was going on and on about families in all his little speeches. I bet you that he has some young kids that he’s not going to see grow up.”</p><p>“You might be right. I had a hard time leaving my sister behind, but she wouldn’t listen to me,” Eenee said, somewhat bitterly. “Gyshy, I said, you have to listen to me! But she was all like, No Eenee, you have to listen to me, you can’t become a traitor, that’s like the worse thing in the universe, or something. Anyway. She wasn’t going to tell me what to do anymore than I was going to tell her what to do, right?”</p><p>“When was the last time you talked to Gyshy?” Harriet inquired politely.</p><p>“About two years, now, I reckon,” Eenee said. “Our last conversation was an argument. Like most of the last things we said to each other. We didn’t get along, my sister and I.”</p><p>“Were you ever close?”</p><p>“Well, of course we were close, we are twins.”</p><p>“Twins?”</p><p>“Yeah, twins. Everyone in my species is a twin. The only children on my world only happen if one of the dies before being born. Everyone else is a twin. It was a year in the Rebellion before I realized that most species don’t have that kind of thing set up in their worlds, and that twins are really rare. For us Duvorq, it’s completely normal.”</p><p>“Wow, that’s really interesting. You know,” Harriet said, “they require you to take Alien Cultures at school, but I’ll say that we never had anything this in depth about anyone before.”</p><p>“That’s because most of the alien cultures that you study are ones that aren’t alive anymore. It’s really xenoarchaeology, because the curriculum hasn’t been updated since those worlds were originally conquered like, 200 years ago.”</p><p>“I’m not that keen on history,” Harriet admitted, “I can’t ever get the dates right, and that’s pretty much what history is all about, right?”</p><p>“I don’t think so, and neither does Nall,” Eenee said in a matter of fact way. “We all believe that history is important. We have studied various historical records to gain experience of how to successfully run a rebellion.”</p><p>“And what have you found out?”</p><p>“That most rebellions are crushed, not much longer after they begin.”</p><p>Harriet stopped eating, and Eenee recovered quickly, “But we have resources that they didn’t have, and a lot of rebellions happened before magic was common knowledge, so that’s different too. So, in some ways, we are completely on our own.”</p><p>They both looked at each other, and when they started to eat again, with a few more smiles.</p></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2021-02-24T23:01"><a href="c954b8e6.html">Harriet Starr and the Space Conflict</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">harriet-starr</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">scene</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.20.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
