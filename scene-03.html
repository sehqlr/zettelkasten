some important information about the Empire’s new superweapon that they will use to end the Rebellion once and for all.” Tobial was whispering quickly, as if he was going to die if someone else heard him.</p><p>“I don’t understand what you mean. Who are you?” Eenee whispered back, “I’ve never seen you before at any of the camps. Who are you?”</p><p>“I’m the main engineer for Project Fireball, a superweapon that can destroy planetside populations and wipe out fleets. It’s a genocide machine that must be destroyed or all hope for our families’ survival will die instead.”</p><p>“That’s a melodramatic thing to say,” Harriet said, “Sounds like a story to me.”</p><p>“Hang on though, defectors have been known to show up. Aren’t we all defectors here?” Q’nall insisted, “Besides, we’ve got to get out of here anyway.” He turned to Tobial, “Can you get us off this station? We are cut off from the portkeys in the main corridor, and we don’t have a ship anywhere nearby. How did you get onto the station?”</p><p>“I smuggled aboard the food barge,” Tobial reported, “then I apparated into the gymnasium equipment storage room and tracked you down from there. Please,” Tobial was starting to look like a portrait of doom, “You must deliver this pad to the Rebellion.”</p><p>He proffered the pad to Q’nall, who did not take it, but rather pushed it back into Tobial’s chest. “You deliver it yourself. You are one of us, and we won’t leave you behind. We’re getting out of here.”</p><p>“But how are we getting out of here?” Harriet whined. “I don’t understand why no one thinks before they make proclamations about where they are going or what they are doing. Is this the rebel way?”</p><p>“Sometimes, it has to be, when the odds are against you,” Q’nall said looking directly into Harriet’s eyes. “And the odds are against us now. Unless you have any bright ideas?”</p><p>Harriet took a moment to settle herself in her own mind. What she did on the outside was to look at Q’nall haughtily and then turn her eyes up to the ceiling. What could she possibly offer the Rebellion? She felt as if this were her moment to contribute positively to the cause, but she had no ideas. She remembered how simple life was when it was just school and her life was all about football. If only there was someway to make football work in her favor.</p><p>Maybe, there was a way. Just maybe, football was going to be the answer after all. Heh, she wondered what Elise would have thought of this dumb plan. Or Jem. She wish they were all there with her, to help her out, that was probably not going to happen. She was a traitor, and she couldn’t help to think that all her friends would see her as an enemy now. But after what they did to Autok, there was no turning back. Besides, she didn’t like all of her friends anyway.</p><p>“Okay, I think I might have a plan.”</p><p>“Do be serious, Hare,” Q’nall said in a sigh, “Sarcasm can’t save the day.”</p><p>“Sure it can, in the right moment. Besides, this isn’t about sarcasm. This is about footballs.”</p><p>“How?” Tobial said, “How could this possibly have anything to do with football?” He turned to Q’nall, then Eenee, “Has she ever come up with a plan before? Why is she in charge all of the sudden? I have information vital to the Rebellion and to civilization itself, and we are talking about football?”</p><p>“Not football. Footballs” Harriet enunciated the final buzz sound of “footballs” quite a lot, for emphasis for small minds. “My plan is to get to the equipment room and enchant all the footballs to start bouncing around randomly and wreck havoc on the school. Well, not havoc really, but a really big distraction. While the Armada troops are busy with the distraction, we can leave.”</p><p>“Leave how?” Q’nall asked, but then was interrupted by Eenee.</p><p>“What spell would make footballs go on their own?”</p><p>“We use it all the time at practice,” Harriet said, “So you can do drills and stuff alone if your partner is sick or something. If we cast the spell a couple of times on the footballs, they will bounce around like mad and break stuff. And they hurt when they hit you, I should know, it’s happened to me more than once. I had a black eye one time, seriously.”</p><p>“I don’t think that these footballs will be a completely absorbing distraction, but it could help us clear a path to the portkeys. Once we get on the planet surface, we can hide, and signal a ship to come get us. Then, it’s back to headquarters to take a look at that Project Fireball of yours.”</p><p>Tobial nodded. “Yes, that’s acceptable to me. This information must get to the Rebellion as soon as possible. Everything depends on it.”</p><p>“Fine by me,” Eenee said, “just as long as we get to survive the delivery.”</p><p>“As long as one of us survives, it’ll be worth it,” Tobial said.</p><p>“Then it’s settled?” Q’nall looked at everyone in the room.</p><p>“Yes,” Harriet said, “let’s do the thing, the plan, the plan thing.”</p><p>Everyone nodded together in agreement, then began to apparate away, to the equipment room.</p><p>When Harriet got to the equipment room, Tobial was pointing at a corner, “That’s where I came in. I planned it down to the finest detail. I scryed for a week to find that spot. It’s just above a bulkhead below, so there was less of a chance that someone would hear me apparate in here.”</p><p>Harriet looked around the room. She hadn’t been in here for some time, she did remember where the footballs were stored. She walked over to the bin where they were kept, and opened it up.</p><p>“Here, we have about, oof, maybe 5 balls we can enchant.”</p><p>“Not good enough,” Eenee said, “When I was picturing how this was going to go down, I was thinking like a battalion’s worth of footballs. Like, hundreds.”</p><p>Harriet was puzzled for a moment, then said, “We could multiply them, do you know a multiply spell? Does anyone know one?”</p><p>“I do,” Tobial said, “I copy tools in my department when my workers lose or break theirs.”</p><p>“Okay,” Q’nall said, “but we can’t turn 5 balls into hundreds in here, there’d be no room.”</p><p>“And, it’d take a long time to cast that spell on hundreds of balls. If only there was a way to cast the spell once, and somehow make the footballs multiply as we were moving through the school, we might be able to make it.” She turned to Tobial, “That multiply spell, can you make it triggered by something? Like, say, hitting a wall?”</p><p>Tobial, looked away from Harriet for a moment, and then said, “Yes, I believe you can do it where the ball will multiply when it rapidly decelerates and split the vector on the rebound.”</p><p>“What exactly does that mean?” Eenee said, protesting.</p><p>“What he means is,” Harriet began, “is that the balls will multiply when they hit walls or people, and split the difference on the bounce back. It’ll be utter chaos in the corridors. All I have to do is kick them at the right angles, and we can waltz to the portkey. Well, we’ll have to watch out for the balls too, but since we know what’s going on, and they won’t, that means that we should be able to get to the portkey without much resistance.”</p><p>“Okay, and what will happen when the balls run out of energy?” Eenee insisted.</p><p>“They won’t in a hurry. The bouncing spell is designed to keep drills going for hours if necessary, and they have an added bonus of seeking out a player when they aren’t being actively kicked.”</p><p>“Brilliant,” Eenee said, “I’m convinced. This will make one hell of a story, Nall.”</p><p>“I sure hope so,” Q’nall said. As long as we get out of this alive, I’ll let you tell it too. Even take credit for some parts of this plan, and I won’t talk about your complaining at all.” He smiled, then turned to Harriet, “Are you ready to do this?”</p><p>Harriet looked deeply into Q’nalls eyes and somehow, knew everything was going to be alright after all. She knew it wasn’t going to be the last time she say those eyes. She nodded, then said, “Let’s get to work.”</p><p>The first thing that had to be done was to get the footballs out of the bin, and place them on the floor so that the spells could be cast on them. Tobial drew a magic circle would have made Professor Wickflit cry, as he said, gets the job done. They put the footballs into the circle, one at a time, and they cast their respective spells on them. Tobial went first, casting his spell with precision and his sonic wand. Harriet went second, going through the same motions as she always did when she did this for practice. She never thought she’d be using the spell to destroy school property. She started to have a wicked smile on her face when she thought about all the damage she was going to do. She knew it wasn’t going to be permanent damage, but there was a part of her that was punk rock, and that punk rock part of her was starting to get into a rebellious spirit. Maybe she could make it in the Rebellion after all?</p><hr /><p>The space battle was raging through space, dangerous spells wizzing back and forth across the deep darkness of space. Not even the stars were outshining the magic energy taking place here, and even though there is no sound in space, you can just imagine what a holovid would do to make it sound really epic. There was no telling just how many people were going to die, but it was probably going to be a lot. You see, space battles aren’t like naval battles, which is what the most popular holovids show. No, it is complete zero-g football madness fighting in space. It was all angles and trajectories, and if you messed up, you were out of the game entirely. Small comfort for Harriet, who was currently riding in one of these death traps. She thought that she would never get out of school alive some days, but that was just silly. Here, she could actually die. It wasn’t a joke anymore. But that didn’t stop her from making them.</p><p>“So, what are our chances, Nall? Slim to none? I don’t much like those odds, but I’m sure you face them all the time, right? You and your daring do, or whatever phrasology that you’d use for this kind of moment?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, it’ll do you no good. Really, don’t think about how you are going to die on these kinds of missions. Just focus on doing your job.”</p><p>“But my job is to wait in here until we crash into a space station, how am I not supposed to worry about dying when crashing comes into it?”</p><p>“You do have another job; you are going to have to be my second pilot,” Q’nall looked over his shoulder and winked at Harriet, “You are going to have to perform repairs while in flight. That’s what the android would do if they were here.”</p><p>“I don’t know how to fix a ship, let alone fly one!”</p><p>“Well, then, I guess we are going to have to trust that I won’t be indisposed while we take our flight.”</p><p>As they were going through preflight checks, Harriet began to be aware of a soft sound in her head. Something soothing, something to make her feel more relaxed. she couldn’t figure out why. Maybe someone was trying to tell her something from a distance; she knew that was something that could happen to a Force user, like her. She still couldn’t believe that she was a Force user sometimes. She just thought she was an ordinary magic user. I mean, don’t get her wrong, she was a pretty okay magic user, but she never thought she was really special at it. She thought that she was going to be special because of football, not for being space psychic. That was an odd way to put it, but giving things little nicknames was a way to cope. Didn’t everyone do that? Anyway, she decided to listen to the soothing not-sound and not worry about if it meant anything. She just let her body relax through the rest of the preflight check, which took about 20 minutes from her estimation, but emotionally it was 3 hours.</p><p>When they were finally ready, Q’nall turned to Harriet again. “Ready?” he asked.</p><p>After a moment, Harriet replied, “Ready and waiting, sir.”</p><p>The way that spacecraft worked in this universe is that there’s a magic spell that removes the effects of gravity on the ship, and then there’s a combustion engine that generates a thrust out of the back of the ship. Because of the contragravity spell, it doesn’t take much push to get a ship off the ground and into the air. It does take a great deal of thrust to make the ships go, but the fuel that they use is used up entirely, without extra emissions beyond what you need to get a jet effect going. The GRQ-11 was designed to last for a week outside of a ship, so the fuel tank was huge. The fuel that they used for their fighters wasn’t flammable until used in the thrust spell circuit, so the ships wouldn’t usually explode horribly once they were downed. Which was a good thing for the Rebellion, since they were shot out of the sky quite a lot. And hitting someone’s ejection pod was really difficult when it was designed to fly around erratically after ejection. That meant that most of the enemy ships would do the same thing, but they tended to explode more. They weren’t designed to save life, they were designed to be fast, so their fuel was a bit more volatile. That gave their ships a speed advantage, but they were also more fragile. The other thing about Imperial ships is that they were too specialized, whereas the Rebellion ships were more generalist. Nearly everyone flew the GRQ-11 in the Rebellion, but in the Armada, you flew about a half-dozen ships in any given fleet: interceptors, bombers, tugboats, you name it, it probably is in there somewhere. There were even special ships for landing ground troops, while the Rebellion generally used their big ships to transport both troops and ships. Although there wasn’t much troop movement these days. Most of the forces left in the Rebellion were dedicated to the different squads that made up their armada of sorts. And Delta Squadron was the best squadron, hands down and feet up, as Eenee would say.</p><hr /><p>Harriet lightly touched the surgical scars on Q’nall’s forehead. “Does that, still hurt?”</p><p>“No, it doesn’t hurt, and the scars with go away someday too.”</p><p>“Why do you have them?”</p><p>“Well, in my species, men don’t have horns. So, since I had them, I had to have them removed, because I’m a trans man. Does that bother you?”</p><p>“I, I didn’t know that aliens could be trans.” Harriet pulled her hand away and looked at Q’nall in a new and slightly suspicious way.</p><p>“Well, not all of them, but most of the species that have two sexes have some form of trans people. Personally, I think it’s the same for any species, but some of them just haven’t accepted it yet. That’s my theory anyway.”</p><p>Harriet found herself needing to ask a question, but it was far too embarrassing to ask directly. Q’nall sensed that there was a question, not what it was. He decided not to ask about it, he had a bad feeling that it was something that he’d been asked over and over again, like, ‘what do your genitals look like’ or something like that.</p><p>“Nall, I have something to ask you,” Harriet said, somewhat bravely.</p><p>“Okay, Hare, what is it? Anything.” Here it comes…</p><p>“Is everybody in your species pink?”</p><p>Q’nall was surprised by this question. He thought everyone knew about his people’s skin color. By space Jesus, they all knew about human skin colors.</p><p>“I’m pink because my mother was pink,” he said finally, “Does that answer your question?”</p><p>“Yes, I think so. I’ll just have to wait and meet more of your people to learn about you.”</p><p>Q’nall and Harriet started holding hands. “If we ever see any of my people again, I promise you, you’ll get to meet them.”</p><hr /><p>There was nothing greater than a food replicator that actually worked. The way that it worked is that you put in a credit chip, and then it would listen to your food order and magic it into existence. You then would open the little hatch to see exactly what you wanted, well, based on what you said anyway. There was a way to enter your own food spells, but Harriet never bothered. The regular food that came out of the little dumbwaiters were quite good, although never as good as home cooking. She would think about her father’s home cooking often. He was nearly a professional chef in her book, and she never ate a meal that wasn’t cooked from scratch at home. Ah, home. Was there anyway that she was going to see her home again? Or was it going to be living in the mud with these other rebels for the rest of her life. Hm. Maybe she should start an association, or even a league, for the Rebellion? She could do something to the dumb rules that the Leagues had put into place, and add in some new ones that would make the game more fun. That was something to think about while eating this spaghetti, she thought to herself. Yes, space spaghetti with space meatballs (actually, they weren’t space meat, it was normal everyday Arturian beef). With black noodles. Her favorite.</p><p>As she grabbed the plate out of the replicator, she saw Eenee eating by herself in the mess hall. Harriet decided to go talk to her. After all, she was going to have to make new friends, right?</p><p>“Hey,” Harriet said as she approached the table, “this seat taken?”</p><p>“Not at all, pull up a chair,” Eenee said, gesturing to the empty spot right across from her. As Harriet laid her tray down on the table, she looked at the black spaghetti and said, “I’ve never seen a meal like that before, what is it?”</p><p>“Black Spaghetti, with white sauce and Arturian meatballs,” Harriet said, “It reminds me of home. My father used to make this for me all the time, completely from scratch. It became my favorite meal to get from the replimat at the school cafeteria. They don’t do Arturian meatballs there, they say that it’s too expensive to get fresh. So I’ve made due with replicated stuff.”</p><p>“Interesting. I’d say that they can’t get Arturian beef is because it’s quite pricey. How did your family afford it?”</p><p>“A lot of my family’s income went into getting quality ingredients for my father. He is practically a professional chef, but he never managed to get something out of his kitchen and onto other people’s plates for money. My grandmother called him a failure behind his back, but he never failed me. He was always there for me.” Harriet started to tear up at the thought of never seeing him again. That thought would not leave her mind. There wasn’t any soft voice of the Force helping her feel better this time either. Sheesh, why was there this tension about her family all of the sudden.</p><p>She looked across the room to Tobial, who was also eating alone, but he was fixating on his plate, and not inviting anyone to join him.</p><p>“Don’t bother,” Eenee said to her. “I tried to socialize with him earlier but he’s not interested. I think that he is having trouble adjusting to the new lifestyle he’s chosen for himself.”</p><p>“I think that he’s just missing someone. You know how he was going on and on about families in all his little speeches. I bet you that he has some young kids that he’s not going to see grow up.”</p><p>“You might be right. I had a hard time leaving my sister behind, but she wouldn’t listen to me,” Eenee said, somewhat bitterly. “Gyshy, I said, you have to listen to me! But she was all like, No Eenee, you have to listen to me, you can’t become a traitor, that’s like the worse thing in the universe, or something. Anyway. She wasn’t going to tell me what to do anymore than I was going to tell her what to do, right?”</p><p>“When was the last time you talked to Gyshy?” Harriet inquired politely.</p><p>“About two years, now, I reckon,” Eenee said. “Our last conversation was an argument. Like most of the last things we said to each other. We didn’t get along, my sister and I.”</p><p>“Were you ever close?”</p><p>“Well, of course we were close, we are twins.”</p><p>“Twins?”</p><p>“Yeah, twins. Everyone in my species is a twin. The only children on my world only happen if one of the dies before being born. Everyone else is a twin. It was a year in the Rebellion before I realized that most species don’t have that kind of thing set up in their worlds, and that twins are really rare. For us Duvorq, it’s completely normal.”</p><p>“Wow, that’s really interesting. You know,” Harriet said, “they require you to take Alien Cultures at school, but I’ll say that we never had anything this in depth about anyone before.”</p><p>“That’s because most of the alien cultures that you study are ones that aren’t alive anymore. It’s really xenoarchaeology, because the curriculum hasn’t been updated since those worlds were originally conquered like, 200 years ago.”</p><p>“I’m not that keen on history,” Harriet admitted, “I can’t ever get the dates right, and that’s pretty much what history is all about, right?”</p><p>“I don’t think so, and neither does Nall,” Eenee said in a matter of fact way. “We all believe that history is important. We have studied various historical records to gain experience of how to successfully run a rebellion.”</p><p>“And what have you found out?”</p><p>“That most rebellions are crushed, not much longer after they begin.”</p><p>Harriet stopped eating, and Eenee recovered quickly, “But we have resources that they didn’t have, and a lot of rebellions happened before magic was common knowledge, so that’s different too. So, in some ways, we are completely on our own.”</p><p>They both looked at each other, and when they started to eat again, with a few more smiles.</p><hr /><p>The new plan was diabolical, even more so than the original diabolical plan. Who was the dark wizard that came up with this plan to the Empress? They should be commended, or killed, or possibly both.</p><p>The plan was to take a sample of an alien species, also known as kidnapping one of them, and then casting the sympathetic spell that will link that alien with all other aliens of that same species.</p><hr /><p>This wasn’t the way that it was supposed to go. The footballs were bouncing around as much as they were expected to; in fact, they were doing even better than expected. They kept multiplying and then bouncing in every possible direction. If Harriet had played Mario Kart, should would have thought about green turtle shells, zooming around the school like some kind of dodecahedral hurricane. This plan was going to work after all, and Harriet was pleased at the damage that it was doing to all the ugly art work and what not on the walls, The moving portraits were all empty now, all the people in the pictures had left their frames to avoid the football Armageddon that was thrust upon them by Harriet and her crew. Were they her crew? Not really, she decided, but they were going to become her crew if she had anything to say about it. She had been waiting to be a team captain for 3 years, now, and in all that time, she never really got more than a meter closer to that goal since Elise was still in charge. It was going to be her season. She was going to at the least be second in command, but she always had a hard time keeping things serious. Her acerbic humor wasn’t going to help her command a unit, or whatever the military term is. I guess she ended up in a military group after all. That was the most popular vocation for people in her school, after bureaucrat. Not many artists were able to make it through the school without getting roped into doing a “good” job for the Empire. Then again, there were those art classes that she was required to take. She couldn’t really figure out what the school was all about anyway. .Was it vocational or academic? Was it meant to turn out artists or technocrats? Which one, school? Which one?</p><p>She digressed. The football plan was working. And now came the moment they were waiting for: apparate to the portkey in the central corridor. Harriet had only just learned how to apparate a few months ago, so she was understandably worried that she was going to cause some kind of problem when she entered the room. Was she going to apparate right into somebody, and cause them to hurt her in some way. Was she going to get someone else hurt?</p><p>She had a sneaky suspicion that the portkey wasn’t going to be there. That wasn’t a real problem. It’s just that, ever since she found out about the Force, she was starting to trust her intuition more and more. Maybe she was going to become some powerful sage after all. Now that would be a laugh, a footballer sage? There shouldn’t be room in the galaxy for that kind of nonsense.</p><p>Okay, it was go time. Tobial waved his laser wand in a complicated pattern to scry into the room where the port key was. Yep, still intact. The way that planetary portkeys work is that you have two identical pieces of glass that have handles on them, to allow for an easy place to grip while you are waiting for it to activate. For a few seconds anyway. Then, the two portkeys switch places, taking along anyone on the station to the surface, and anyone on the surface to the station. For this sort of thing, the portkey access is controlled by a schedule, and the portkey only activates on that schedule. If you were late, you had to make a new appointment to get access to the portkey. However, the plan for this trip was to activate the portkey prematurely by activating the manual mode, which is something that happens in emergencies. And, she thought to herself, this is definitely an emergency. They had information vital to the Rebellion and they were in danger of getting killed by Armada forces.</p><p>Once the coast was clear, Harriet closed her eyes, and imagined herself in the new destination, and… she was there. Perfect, right where she needed to be, right next to the portkey. She reached over and pulled the lever that activates the manual mode.</p><p>just as she was doing that, a football flew right into her field of vision. Without thinking, she headed the ball – right into the portkey.</p><p>It smashed. It was like a bejeweled snowfall, the way that the crystal shattered against the wall and all the glass fell down to the ground. This was what her intuition was telling her, that she was going to have to accept that the plan wasn’t going to work anymore.</p><p>Q’nall was the first to speak after the portkey was smashed, “What happened?”</p><p>“I headed the ball and, and, and, I broke it!” Harriet was almost in tears and almost yelling at the top of her lungs, but not quite. Everyone could tell that she was really upset, that’s the point.</p><p>“Don’t worry, the planetside portkey will arrive in less than a minute,” Tobial said, while waving his hands to try to keep the footballs at bay, “Then we’ll just activate the portkey again, and we’ll be off!”</p><p>“And it’ll keep them from following us. Good job, Hare!” Jem said. And Harriet was glad that Jem was there. How did she ever guess that Jem was on her side! I wonder how many of her other dorm mates felt the same way about the Empire?</p><p>However, the celebration was cut short when a laser wand blast exploded one of the footballs in midair, really close to where Harriet’s face was.</p><p>“Take cover!” Eenee shouted, drawing her own laser wand and launching an Expelliarmous spell. It didn’t connect, but it did give everyone enough time to duck into various tables and things that were in the corridor. Why were there these things in the corridor, hasn’t anyone heard of safe walkways? Harriet moaned in her mind as she found a debate podium to hide behind.</p><p>It seemed like minutes. Spells flying everywhere, footballs flying everywhere, it was a completely chaotic situation and Harriet had some experience with that, since she was a zero-g footballer.</p><hr /><p>The laser wand is a fascinating piece of magitechnology, if you were interested in learning about such things. The way that it worked was similar to how ancient wands worked, except instead of wood carved from a tree, it is metal, forged by a wandsmith. Wandsmiths only create the metal housing: the person that the wand is made for is made by another person, typically the student that needs the wand themselves. The metal wands used by modern space wizardry are composed of three parts: the core, the focusing crystal, and the barrel. The barrel is just the skinny part of a wand that slides out of the main housing. It allows for adjusting how focused on a beam you want to make. The furthest setting is good for long distance spells, whereas the shortest setting is useful for magic at home. There are other modules that you can add to it. Some wands are laser wands because the focusing crystal produces a beam of light: other wands have different crystals that have different properties. For example, the sonic wand has a piezoelectric crystal that produces sound rather than light. This means that the wand isn’t too good for fighting, but because the sound focusing crystal can have many different harmonics, it is easier to mix and match spells, or combine a spell with a metaspell. Metaspells are spell on spells, and where only discovered after programmers got their hands on magical artifacts and tested out computer theory on ancient wooden wands and texts. But that was ancient history. Most mages carry at least a laser wand, and people who work on magitech all the time often carry a sonic wand because they are much more suited to working on devices rather than more direct spells that are directed at people.</p><hr /><p>You’re probably wondering how in the world that the magic users of Harry Potter figured out how to do space travel, and create such a thing as a galactic empire. Well, lemme tell you, it wasn’t easy. First, they had to come out of hiding to save the world from global warming. That was the beginning of the Magic Age, and everyone was grateful for their work in reducing carbon in the atmosphere and all the other stuff they did. Mostly what happened was they sequestered the existing carbon by extracting the carbon from the atmosphere and sealing it underground as solid graphite. Then, the magic users couldn’t got back into hiding could they. They didn’t know how much magic it would take to erase all those memories, but they did, and they tried , but it just wourldn’t work. There were too many people who know now, and with there being the internet and all there was now way that they were able to keep a secret like they did in the dinosaur age. So anywhoodle, they decided that the couldn’t be in hiding anymore, so they decided to try to integrate with muggle society. That part wasn’t easy. There were people who trying to protest their ways, saying that it was like satanist stuff, and people all over the world assumed that the world was coming to an end because magic users were now in the open. However, more and more people began to accept them into their societies, and after about 20 years, most of the doubters had quieted down and now there was a way into the world for the mages of ages past. So, they did what they normally did, living life in their special neighborhoods. But, a few curious mages decided that they were going to live with the muggles, right next to them even (think people like Author Weasley). So, after a time, people started to accept mages, even when they started popping up on their own in the general population. See, when the Statute of Secrecy was repealed, magic users were no longer whisked away to secret schools in order to learn. They started finding each other on the internet and teaching each other new things. Once the schools realized this was going on, they started excepting more and more diverse students into their fold that was a way to make sure that the kids weren’t getting into trouble and all that nonsense. So schools like Hogwarts and Madam du whatsit and durmstrang had to accept more students, and more schools had to be built while the demand was growing. And it was growing, because as soon as inventors found out about magic, magitechnology was born. Mixing magic and technology turns out to work pretty well since spells can inhabit objects, and those objects can in turn cast spells independently of their owners. That was figured out by Maxine Stromboli, a janitor’s assistant in South America. She enchanted mops to do their own mopping and they started casting cleaning spells instead of mopping. That was something really cool that happened in the past and that I’m telling you about right now.</p><p>So, how did they get into space? you ask, where the Star Wars part of the story takes over. You see, when magitech was applied to space travel, at first they used spells to make things bigger on the inside than on the outside, you know, to get delivery rates over their old ways? Anyway, they figured out how to make that cool space fluid mixture I hinted at earlier in the manuscript, where it isn’t really flammable until it’s ignited? Kinda like blast gel? Anyway, the thinking went that if you increased the side of the ships inside, that’s would solve the affordability crisis of space travel, and because the fuel didn’t leave any pollution, that would be the cause of celebration of space enthusiasts and environmentalists at all the same time. So, this was a good time to be a magitech engineer, you never had any shortage of jobs. So, NASA sent out it’s first magic rocket about fifty years after contact with the magical community, and they launched their first rocket to mars shortly after that.</p><hr /><p>The Rebellion’s flagship, the Alien Friendship, was losing atmosphere and fast. It had no power, and they were all kinds of other stuff wrong with it. It was not the place to be right now, so Harriet, Jem, and their parents were all going to get onto escape pods and really get out of there as quickly as possible. So, they ran. Ran, ran, ran, ran and ran. They were surrounded by dead bodies all the way to the escape pods. And that wasn’t all. A few of the escape pods had dead bodies in them, so that was a pretty hard thing to do, to remove dead bodies, so you could live. that kind of thing gives you nightmares and permanent mind scars, so don’t do it kids. unless you have to. to survive. and that was what they were doing right now, surviving.</p><p>It was survival that they had in mind when they decided to board separate escape pods. They were pretty small, and so they were thinking about the oxygen atmosphere in them running out. So they split up. There was no reason why that was a bad idea right? They were going to wind up in about the same place, so there was no way that they were going to die separately.</p><p>That’s what exactly happened. Just as her parents pod was launched it, and the two people inside, were killed. There was nothing that anyone could do about it.</p><hr /><p>“We don’t want to have the aliens live in our worlds anymore!” The Empress Augusta Regalus Victoria declared. “We want them out of our worlds and they should stay out. Our Empire is for the human species, and not for anyone else. It is humans that have built this empire from their blood and bones, and we can keep their memory pure by keeping the aliens out. They are a kind of bad thing that I don’t want around any more. And to make an example of them, to show you exactly what I mean, I shall kill and execute this alien who you all know as Autok of Khell. He has been found guilty of sedition and of cheating in zero-g football, he was definitely cheating because we made up a rule that says that he has biological enhancements that he’s not allowed to have because he is an alien. There is no way that anyone could think that he didn’t do anything wrong because that’s what I say, and what I say goes and I really hope that you all will vote for me in the coming election. Because somehow I wrote in Trumpese, not regal emperessness. So there. I have fun everyone, I have fun.”</p><hr /><p>That war against the station was brutal. Turns out that Project Fireball is a killing machine designed by sadists. Dark wizards manned the battle stations, as they had been trained in ship combat by the Armada forces. Once they figured out how to do it, they were able to shape the beams from the weapon ports into seeker spells, and that increased accuracy which caused a lot more death, Which is fine, there are these space wizards called void wizards, they are kinda like necromancers and deatheathers combined, where they go around space battle fields and gather bodies to use in horrible magical experiments to try to extend human life beyond it’s natural end. There are whole armies of the Sith that are just reanimated corpses. The wizards got the idea from George Romero so they are legit zombies, none of this off the lower shelf bullshit that passes for zombies these days.</p><p>Anyway, so there were dark wizards going around scooping up dead bodies from wars that they cause and this is all a bit too much for me right now, let’s write about something else.</p><p>The way that Harriet and Jem are friends but not in a relationship is supposed to be like how Harry and Herminonie is, but since they aren’t actually attracted to each other, this will actually work as a friendship. No love triangles here, but maybe later, if I write more romance into the story, which is something that I want to do eventually. Hm. I think that Harriet is rather clueless about love, which is why it takes a handsome alien to be patient with her enough to realize that they are in fact in love like everyone will want them to be by the time that I’m finished with them. I really hope that I can write romance scenes even though I never tried it before, but then again I haven’t ever tried to write scenes out of order, and I’m going about it pretty well I think. The main problem is that I don’t always revisit scenes when I should and I forget about them. Which means that I’ll have to add it during revisions, and that would make the novel last a bit longer on the workbench before it is ready. But that’s okay, I’ve done the writing part before, I’ve done editing short stories before, how bad could it be?</p><p>So, what ends up happening is that Harriet lives with Jem’s family, and they become like sibling-friends, which is an interesting relationship that could play out in sequels. Oh god, am I planning sequels now? Jesus, I have to finish this manuscript first, and edit it, before I can get to any conclusions about sequels. Jesus again.</p><hr /><p>“So, here we are, in the middle of burning wreckage” Jem started to panic. “How do you rebels deal with this?”</p><p>“I’m pretty new, so I have no idea how rebels deal with this. They don’t have rebel school you know.” Harriet said saltily.</p><p>“Wait, where are my parents? Shouldn’t they be here? I can see your parents, but I can’t find mine. What I felt in space, it can’t be true, it can’t be true!”</p><p>And so, this scene is where we find out definitely that Harriet’s parents have been killed by Project Fireball as the ship that they were on got blown from the sky in a real bad way. The reason why they were all on that ship? I have no idea, I’ll have to think of it either now or later, and I’m busy right now telling you a story and having back trouble. Anyway, so this death scene is sad, probably the most emotional that the book will get. I’m going to have to really dig deep and be vulnerable for this, but I’m not in that state of mind right now and I can’t think of a way of digging that deeply and doing wars at the same time. That might have to be a scene that get’s written in like the second draft or something. Like the sex scenes. But I’m not sure there should be any sex scenes. but then again, I’m taking fan fiction as an inspiration and we all know that fan fiction involves really weird sex scenes that don’t make any sense and aren’t really that sexy, but what can you do? This is Harry Potter and Star Wars mashed up, and they don’t deal with sex hardly at all. Then again, they don’t deal with trans positively either, so we’ll see. We’ll have just to wait and see.</p><p>Meanwhile, back and the death star, the way that this works is that we start the story with Tobial being a lowly engineer, working on something that raises his suspicious nature to the fore and gives him a first glimpse into what the station does. His realization at what it does is when we discover what it does and he defects. He’s going to be cut in a bunch into the early story, then when he joins the alliance he like become a big deal general because of his information and the upshot is that his family ends up needing to be saved by him and he rescues them and that is how his whole family comes into the rebellion, because the Empress wants to make an example of him just like he thought was going to happen, but hey, he’s able to get everybody out, well, maybe someone dies, but I haven’t decided yet.</p><p>Anyway, what happens to Eenee is that she doesn’t reconcile with her sister twin at all, and when her twin get’s injured, she refuses to get rescued, so it’s like not everyone is willing to come over to the rebellion, no matter how bad it gets for them.</p><hr /><p>So, let me tell you about the school that Harriet goes to. It is called the Calvary School for Intuitiionists, and it turns out to be a school for mages that have the Intuition, which is the equivalent of the Force in this universe. The Intuition is what gives someone sensitive to it the power to see a little bit into the future, or have some greater intuitive sense of mathematics or piloting, or what have you. Anytime that someone has a mental ability that they cannot explain with magic, they explain as the Intuition. Now, Harriet has the Intuition fairly strongly, and that’s why she was especially sought out. Basically, this school is like the Jedi Academy, where the Jedi kidnap children to raise in their religion and their cutlish ways while they have space wizard powers.</p><p>Man, that is really tedious to try to write out how I feel about something instead of having a character voice speaking though me. But then again, there is the fact that I’ve been going at this for house and hours today, and I’m nearly going to write more than 8k words in one day, you mark those words because they need to be counted for the competition, oh boy am I loosing the thread of this novel right now. At least it’s not like it was back in 2013 when I won with a manuscript that was about half my ramblngs about my personal feelings.</p><p>I definitely couldn’t get that manuscript edited with all that stuff out of it fast enough. After I removed those parts, I had a manuscript that was about 25k words and it was mostly prose like this, where I’m just talking at the top of my head and writing it down instead of getting into a character, which is more fun, trust me.</p><p>It’s going to be different this year, I’m not going to have any personal ramblings except for this kind of stuff, my goal is to not have half the manuscript go missing after I edit those parts out. But words are words. Then again, I am at the end of a long and stressful day, and maybe I should rest instead of continuing to do this ting. Then again, I am in the middle of a word war right now, so I’ll finish that up and then call it a night. I’ll do something else that’s relaxing, or I’ll just watch some TV, which is also good.</p><p>Maybe the school name is wrong, I thought that I might have called it something else, earlier, and the fact that it’s got intuitionist in the name is a bit overly direct, I need it to be less X-men and more Harry Potter, which means a silly name for a silly place in a silly world. Well, not that silly, there are some grim things that happen in harry potter I guess. I should make it scarier at the scary parts.</p></div><div class="metadata"><div class="date" title="Zettel date"><time datetime="2020-11-24T21:20">2020-11-24</time></div></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">scene/03</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.20.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
