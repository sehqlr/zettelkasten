Reading Response: Friedlander and Lee 307-320; Kramer and Call 164-178

SUMMARY:

Journalism is fact-based, truthful writing/fragment that tells a story. Today’s
readings focus on how to be truthful in an ethical sense. In the
Friedlander and Lee chapter on ethics, their discussion initially quotes
the First Amendment, but then makes the argument that theoretical total
freedom of speech must be curtailed, then ends with a lecture on forming
your own ethical standards…within their guidelines. The Kramer and Call
readings that I chose focus on individual experiences of ethical
journalism.

RESPONSE:

This curtailing of free speech that Friedlander and Lee discuss comes in
the form of laws governing libel, invasion of privacy, and copyright.
This section is very important to what we have learned in this class.
What crosses the line between interviewing and invading? When does
“tough but fair” portrait become libel? There is also the discussion of
plagiarism that sounded very familiar to students of all ages, but the
legal aspect was a new one. Maybe copyright law should be taught to
college freshmen composition classes?

Another thing that caught my eye was the mention of the Comic Magazine
Association of America and their ethical guidelines. This ethical
standard that Friedlander and Lee do not mention by name is the Comics
Code Authority, formulated in 1954. Here is the Wikipedia rendition of
the rules:

-   Crimes shall never be presented in such a way as to create sympathy
    for the criminal, to promote distrust of the forces of law and
    justice, or to inspire others with a desire to imitate criminals. 
-   If crime is depicted it shall be as a sordid and
    unpleasant activity.
-   Criminals shall not be presented so as to be rendered glamorous or
    to occupy a position which creates a desire for emulation.
-   In every instance good shall triumph over evil and the criminal
    punished for his misdeeds.
-   Scenes of excessive violence shall be prohibited. Scenes of brutal
    torture, excessive and unnecessary knife and gunplay, physical
    agony, gory and gruesome crime shall be eliminated.
-   No comic magazine shall use the word horror or terror in its title.
-   All scenes of horror, excessive bloodshed, gory or gruesome crimes,
    depravity, lust, sadism, masochism shall not be permitted.
-   All lurid, unsavory, gruesome illustrations shall be eliminated.
-   Inclusion of stories dealing with evil shall be used or shall be
    published only where the intent is to illustrate a moral issue and
    in no case shall evil be presented alluringly, nor so as to injure
    the sensibilities of the reader.
-   Scenes dealing with, or instruments associated with walking dead,
    torture, vampires and vampirism, ghouls, cannibalism, and
    werewolfism are prohibited.
-   Profanity, obscenity, smut, vulgarity, or words or symbols which
    have acquired undesirable meanings are forbidden.
-   Nudity in any form is prohibited, as is indecent or undue exposure.
-   Suggestive and salacious illustration or suggestive posture
    is unacceptable.
-   Females shall be drawn realistically without exaggeration of any
    physical qualities.
-   Illicit sex relations are neither to be hinted at nor portrayed.
-   Violent love scenes as well as sexual abnormalities
    are unacceptable.
-   Seduction and rape shall never be shown or suggested.
-   Sex perversion or any inference to same is strictly forbidden.
-   Nudity with meretricious purpose and salacious postures shall not be
    permitted in the advertising of any product; clothed figures shall
    never be presented in such a way as to be offensive or contrary to
    good taste or morals.

I’m sure that Friedlander and Lee don’t want to associate personal
systems of ethics with this long list of censorship rules, but it’s fun
to think of it in that way.

The Kramer and Call readings offered a more personal approach to the
formulation of ethical standards. Roy Peter Clark gave two simple rules
to follow: Do not add. Do not deceive. Walt Harrington tells us that
feature writers owe their honesty with their subjects, their editors,
and their audience. Isabel Wilkerson writes about empathy and its role
in ethical journalism. Tracy Kidder and Katherine Boo both talk about
reporting with consent. With these writers, we get a look at the
personal ethics that Friedlander and Lee talk about.

These readings essentially encourage writers to treat their subjects
like people. Be human to the humans that you study. Editors and their
rules get you paid but the subjects are giving their time, money, and
attention to you—which is arguably more important in an intellectual
sense.
