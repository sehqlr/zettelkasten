It was a late Saturday afternoon and there was no way that she was ever going to do anything on a late Saturday afternoon except catch up on her favorite web comic known as Balloon and Pin. It was a long running web comic, one of the first that she ever heard of and she was on the internet for a long while before many of her friends were. She was the one searching for Lisa Frank artwork on the web, the first one to get a facebook when it was made available to noncollege students , and she was the first one to experiment with WOW before she realized that she was addicted and her grandmother Grace had to take away the internet and get Jill a library card. Balloon and Pin is the collected adventures of Balloon man and Pin man. One, Balloon man, is actually Ballooon Hand Man, and he has balloon hands and they can become lots of different shapes and his purpose in life was too entertain the children but then along came Pin man a man made out of Pins and he follows Balloon around trying always to pop the balloon hands and such. The adventures started about pretty normally for that, but they whole point of the web comic for the artist is to write a story graphically in every genre ever. The website has been updated for a long time now and at the current moment, Balloon and Pin are in a romantic comedy, going to the Navy pier and stuff like that, so Jill was pretty excited to be witnessing that sort of thing and she’s drinking her Mountain Dew even though she’s exceeded her daily limit, oh goodness how Grace gives her grace in life but cannot express how much Grace loves her when her parents split and Jill didn’t chose either of them, but chose Grace instead. Yes, Grandma Grace was the rock in Jill’s life and not even the cheating divorcées that call themselves her parents can compete with the grandmother that doesn’t leave, doesn’t change, and only death will separate them its not like Grace as was going to dies soon anyway, but it did occur to her sometime, but only in brief seconds between cookie sheets and warm cookies. And the stray cats. Stray cats are by far the thing that unites the two girls, separated by generational differences. Both of them loved to care for strays for brief moments in time between releasing them into the cold, wild concrete city that they live in. Stray cats were a distraction away from the decadence that Grace believed that the city would bring to her precious Jil’ro. Jil’ro. That’s a name that Grace came up with when Jill was very little. Cradling her in her warm, wrinkly arms, Grace said that a good name for a baby needs to be simple and easy to say and especially for her little friends, when she starts to get them. But that was the cradling time, not quite time for true friendship. But Jill wasn’t the most charismatic or sociable person, and never grew up to be that person. She spent much time on the computers. Grace couldn’t help but think of all of those science fiction movies that she watched when she was a teenager, and how distant that danger was for her, but how now brown cow that the future always comes true, doesn’t it? It’s almost like God knows, and he likes to poke his head in sometimes and tell us what the future is in ways that he we cannot understand. It is his sense of humor, more than likely . Computers aren’t alive, or they wont be for a while. That’s why she likes to call the desktop Robbie. Hopefully, Robbie stays on the Forbidden Planet like he’s supposed to . Don’t turn into Gort, please spare the rest of us.</p><p>But cats. They are the things that are alive and at that Roe will like , to care for, to connect with, and that’s good.</p><p>It was this particular. Saturday that a crazy cat came in to Jillian’s life that would be the end of normality. This was a day that would go ton to be the most important one ever. No one could ever predict this. If god existed and he was poking his head in , he would be laughing his ass off about now. Jill would never know. Well, not for the next few weeks anyway.</p><p>When there was a scratching at the door, the screen door that separated out the grandmother’s house from the rest of the city, there is a little foyer that Grace uses to leave food out for the strays. If a stray wants the food enough, it’ll scratch. Thats what has always happened, anyway. Here was a sratching, but this scratching seemed more subtle, like a door knocking type of a scratching, as opposed to the desperation of a dumb animal. Well, not dumb, just uneducated, unavailable for education. Its seemed to Grace that this particular scratching was intellegent. The feeling left her, and was quickly replaced with the usual response to a hungry stray, to help them with the door, to always let the little montsters in, and eat of the hospitality that was of Grace’s kitchen.</p><p>Grace, calling towards the upstairs, “Jilro, there’s a stray. Got off that damned Robbie and get down here to help connect with and welcome out little guest.”</p><p>“Granny, what kind is it?”</p><p>“No, you can’t look it up on Wikipedia. You can’t update Twitter or FaceBook to do that sort of thing. You cannot do that you just need to get your tuckis down here.”</p><p>Jill was happy to log out of the computer. She was feeling her body start to decay form lack of movement, to atrophy her soul. She only needed a helpful figure like Grace to get her wakeful. She had little amount of willpower to work with after all. She went down the hardwood stairs and around the corner to the kitchen where the outer door entered into, where the strays come into .Strays were meant to come in from the back, Grace said. You can’t expect any more people in the front door, those are all just drunks, homeless, drug dealers, drug users, pimps, prostitutes, and Jehovah Witness’s. Yes, the back door is the true way that strays should come in. That’s how we should do things.</p><p>So the cat was finally let in. It actually stopped periodically through the whole process, which made Grace think those odd things again, but she left those thoughts in the back corner of her mind again. Is she getting senile? Is death that much closer? While she ponders, that, the second door was finally opened, and the cat was able to come into the foyer where the food was.</p><p>When Jill arrived on the scene, she was startled by the look of the stray. To begin with, it was a cat, but that wasn’t too odd, because most of the strays were dogs or cats. Cats were pretty common in this part of the city. that roaming dog packs tended to form on the east part of town. This cat was different though. It was oddly shaped. She noticed first that the face of the cat was more squat than usual. More like a pug dog’s face. Two stripes below the circular pupils. Green with a bit of brown in the middle. Short ears. Dots and spots on the top of it’s head. The tail was very bushy, like cats are when they are angry but this one picked it out like an afro. A tailfro. It were more stripes down the back side, and short legs. It was easily the weirdest cat that she had ever seen. But somehow more familiar than she could possibly know. This was the oddest thing that she had felt since the first time that she realised that Balloon and Pin wasn’t about balloon hands or pins, it wasn’t about whether or not the kids laugh at their antics, it wasn’t about whether or not they were going to solve the mystery of the Haystack, it wasn’t about whether or not they were going to fall in love or be too scared to try, but rather about graphic literature, and the position that is has in the world, and whether or not anyone cares about art that doesn’t have superheros in it.</p><p>The cat’s eyes, that was the weirdest part. She could tell that there was an intelligence there, an intelligence that went far beyond the normal animal intelligence, that the light shining in those green-brown eyes that this was the kind of intelligence that you could use an abacus for, at least an abacus, maybe even a graphic calculator if the cat ever got opposable thumbs. Maybe the kind of intelligence that the people see all the time on Animal planet, but Jill never quite believes in. She ‘s just had doubts is all. Shes’ never seen anything that couldn’t have been photo-shopped or hoaxed at one point in time, she has always had crushing skepticisms. Because of this she had a hard time trusting in people. That’s why she prefers strays and the internet. At least on the internet you could ignore all the pathological liars, and call them out on his or her lies without them knowing who you are, and attacking your ego, your frail, frail ego. The only one that truely believes in you all the time is Granny, the only person that doesn’t care who you are just as long and you are your best self. Mommy and daddy aint like that. They expect things from you, things you cannot provide. Mommy wants you to go to liberal arts school like she did, so you can teach like she did, so you can have job security like she did. Like that gave you security, that didn’t give you life security like Granny does. Daddy wants you to go to law school like he did, or business or something like that, so you can get a job in the private sector and have a job with at least a bit of freedom so you can go and live life instead of being in a school until you’re a geriatric and die. But you let your marriage get cold and die, didn’t you Daddy? Granny can’t do that to me. She wont, and she never will. Ever.</p><p>The cat was starting at her. Like reading her mind or something. How is that? How is that cat reading her mind? No one has that kind of stare, I don’t care who you are. Are you a mind reader, little cat?, cause I’m not. No one can do that. Nobody.</p><p>“Granny, is that cat a mind reader?” “What do you mean Jil’ro?”</p><p>“That cat. It’s staring into my soul. It needs to stop.”</p><p>“Well, if that cat can read minds, maybe it can tell you went to go out into the sunlight on a Saturday. It’s not like you ever do anymore homework on Saturdays. You just sit inside all the time. On the other hand, this cat has been out and about all day long. And probably has been to more places than we think it has. Maybe you can learn something from this cat? Learn something about how it lives life, out in the open?”</p><p>“Maybe, Granny, maybe. Maybe it can teach me how to get frosting on my tips, like it does on it’s fur. Maybe, in time, it can teach me how to cat burgle.”</p><p>They both laughed a bit. Light chuckles and such. They had no idea that they were 2000% right about everything they just said. It was freaking cool. How they didn’t know. I’m totally psyched about telling you this story.</p><p>Anyway, so the cat starts purring. The kind of purring that a cat makes when being petted and loved, not talked about in the third person and ignored. It hasn’t even eaten the food that Grace put out for it.</p><p>“Maybe that cat isn’t hungry, maybe he or she wanted to put in a social call for the whole of everybody.”</p><p>“Possibly. I mean, it hasn’t touched the Fancy Feast you put out. That gets them most to the time. Maybe if you switched to Meow Mix it’ll eat and then be happy. Maybe it’ll sing for us, too.</p><p>“Just thinking about that makes me very happy inside, Jil’ro.”</p><p>The cat perked out its ears, its short, short ears. That is a weird cat all right. Jill couldn’t quite figure it out. Maybe that cat will sing and dance and do the abacus and show her a thing or two, but probably not.</p><p>Maybe Jill does need to get out more. Maybe she does need to get away from her escapism. Maybe she does need to ge more sunlight her soft, pale skin. But there are some clouds rolling in. Maybe it’ll rain, and Jill couldn’t help but think about how much that would ruin a perfectly good walk.</p><p>The cat didn’t go for the food when they first started talking about it. But, about halfway through their conversation, it did. No singing and dancing. No abacus. No life lessons learned. Just munching. But those eyes, the tail, those markings. What kind of cat is that?</p><p>“I’m going back upstairs.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I need my camera”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I need to upload a picture of this cat. So I can figure out what is it. I’ve never seen a cat like that before, Granny.</p><p>“I haven’t either, but I’m sure that our little friend isn’t going to stay long enough for a photo shoot and a library search.”</p><p>“Granny I know you know how much I’ve got to figure this stuff out. It’ll bother me the rest of the day. Possibly for the rest of my life.</p><p>“Fine. Go fetch Robbie, and have him do everything for you.</p><p>“Granny, it won’t cause all of the technology in the world to stop. I promise. I just need to find out what kind of cat this is.”</p><p>“Fine. But if this oven stops working while I’m baking, I’m coming after you.”</p><p>It wasn’t much a of a big deal to fetch the camera. It was on the part of the bookshelf in Jill’s room to hold all of the electronic paraphernalia that she uses. The camera, the digital photo frame that her parents got for her when they split up. The books on her shelf are not much suprise for a girl of her age. She tended to keep a copy of all the books she read in school that she liked, so Number the Stars, Tom Swayer, Huck Finn, Wrinke in time so on. She has some Tim O’Brien in there, she was introduced to him by a boy that had an irreversible crush on her. She didn’t like him for the same reason that she didn’t like any nobody. Too untrustworthy. She’s read those adult books. She’s heard about cheating. Who’s stopping Charlie to do that to her? Plus, Charlie lives on the other side of the city and there is no way that Granny would drive her through the city, nothing in the whole world that would convince her. Granny was afraid of the people that live here. It wasn’t the fact that some of them weren’t white, she’s said over and over, again. It’s just the fact that all people can be addicted to crack and want to murder for it. Anybody can wield a gun. Nobody can dodge them every well. That’s all. So, no Charlie boyfriend for Jill.</p><p>Once the camera had been fetched and turned on, Jill went back downstairs to the room, where the cat was still eating. It seemed like the cat had waited for her to return. What a weird cat. How is it that it’s still working on it. First, its’ s a master of etiquette, a working connoisseur of manners, waiting for the humans to tell it can eat. And how it is waiting for her? With the camera in her hand, she can begin to investigate the most elusive mystery, what species of cat this is.</p><p>The camera took the photo effortlessly. The cat finished the plate. It looked at the humans again. It looked from Granny all the way around the kitchen t o Jill. It’s studying the scene; Jill know this but didn’t know this.</p><p>Granny had to show the cat out. Strays are only temporary guests, didn’t you know. The cat seemed to understand, and it seemed like it was making obvious plans to come back and further the plot.</p><p>The forums that Jill found weren’t too helpful to begin with. They all didn’t know what it was. Sure, they all pretended to know, but they were making stuff up. They argued back and forth with angry words whether or not it was a mix of this or that kind of cat. But none of them were of any authority. I mean, they can’t spell, or write full sentences. Of course they didn’t know anything. They only eliminated the possibilities of what it was not. It was only the next time that they cat showed up when Jill was prepared for the knowledge that was about to become privy to.</p><p>Two weeks after, on another Saturday afternoon. Raining. She didn’t know how it was possible, but she was looking on Wikipedia., and somehow, she found it.: Pallas’s cat. The article described what the cat looked like immediately: the ears, the eyes, the tail, the stripes, the everything.</p><p>Then the information that threw more confusion to the situation. The cats are native to Asia. How is it that an Asian cat native to the Himalayas for Pete’s sake, wind up in America? And it’s a wild cat, and no body would have possibly kept it was as pet. Maybe it was cat to somebody that like to raise exotic pets, the ones that you can’t always get in a pet store, like that one show that they have on Animal Planet? Maybe. She was about to figure out how much it would be to buy an Pallas’s cat on eBay or somtehing like that when her granny shouted form the kitchen.</p><p>“Jill, that weird cat is here again.</p><p>“Oh god. how could this happen?</p><p>Jill got to the kitchen, and there it was. Granny didn’t even have any food out this time, and she came back, for a social call. She was one fucking weird, you know? There was no way that this cat should be going out of way just for a social call. Too many coincidences. But if there weren’t any coincidences, would this be a story?</p><p>“Granny, you know where this cat actually comes from?</p><p>“So don’t know, Jil’ro, I don’t know. I don’t think that it’s of this earth.</p><p>“Granny, of course it’s of this earth. Just not of this city. This is a Pallas’s cat, it comes from Asia. You know, China and shit.</p><p>“Don’t you curse, young lady.</p><p>“Sorry Granny, I’m just saying that I read about it on Wikipedia.”</p><p>“Oh, so that ’s that huh? All the knowledge?</p><p>“I couldn’t find anything on any forums, anyway, I think that somebody may have bought this cat because it’s exotic. Like somebody owning a tiger.</p><p>“Maybe it came from the zoo?</p><p>“Doubtful. We would have read about it in a newspaper.</p><p>“True. You know, that makes sense. I agree with that. People keep snakes and rocks as pets, why not a manageable tiger?</p><p>“OK, that cat is definitely starting to freak me out now. Shy away, little tiger! You should be back with your owner, whoever that is.”</p></div><div class="metadata"><div class="date" title="Zettel date"><time datetime="2020-11-24T13:51">2020-11-24</time></div></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2020-11-11T19:51"><a href="050f356a.html">Novels</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;age/highschool&#39;">age/highschool</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;age/year-of-desperation&#39;">age/year-of-desperation</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;writing/novels/jilro&#39;">writing/novels/jilro</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.10.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
