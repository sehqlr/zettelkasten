What is Harriet's favorite coffee drink? I think black coffee without
anything in it, because she's like that, and she will choke down a bad
coffee without complaining because coffee isn't supposed to be any good.
When it comes to tea though, Harriet prefers something more Delicious
than that. I want to say peppermint, but that's too close to the real
person that Harriet is being modeled after. Instead, I want to have her
like something like cardamom tea or something like that something
floral. That's her drink of choice, and of course water. They have water
in the future still, right?

Does she drink alcohol? Actually, only tastes of it, she doesn't want to
poison her body with alcohol that much. This is an irrational belief
that she has held onto from young childhood and refuses to let go, even
though it is completely ridiculous and illogical, but that's our Harriet.
Just something about everything that she needs to have an opinion on.
