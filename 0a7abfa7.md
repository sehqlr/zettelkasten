steve

Naota says:

**sam**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

hello, steve

Naota says:

**you have msn now!**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yep

Naota says:

**weeeeeeeeeeeee**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yes, I have actually had it for a while, but I never saw the need

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

so what up wit you

Naota says:

**doing homework**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

oh

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

loser

Naota says:

Naota says:

**bastard**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

so…about this Anime thingy

Naota says:

**what is adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir?**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

“Adrod is ancient and not a dumb-head”

Naota says:

**okay….and the rest?**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

huh?

Naota says:

**oh wait…I just noticed the quotes….what is it from?**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

it is ‘sa-mic’, a language I started to create

Naota says:

**yes…I know what sa-mic is…you’ve told me about it several times**

Naota says:

**WHAT DOES IT MEAN!**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

oh, you mean, the actual phrase? pure fiction. I was only intended to test out how grammer would work

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

it*

Naota says:

Naota says:

***frustration***

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

well, Adrod was a charactor name for myself at first, but then I decieded he is the Historian of Time

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

the Lorekeeper of Eternity

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

and so on and so forth

Naota says:

**so anyway…**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

about this Anime thing-gy

Naota says:

**…**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

do you have any preconceptual ideas?

Naota says:

**no…I haven’t worked on anything**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

cool

Naota says:

**oh…but I also remember after hanging up last time that it’s not always an “object”…it could be a goal of some sort…like in Naruto…becoming a Ninja**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

aha

Naota says:

**or in Sailor Moon fighting crime**

Naota says:

**and saving the world**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

I think it should be something obscure

Naota says:

**but ironically I hear at the end of Sailor Moon they fail and the Earth is destroyed**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

haha

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

was it by the Vogons?

Naota says:

**no…it was by some evil space alliance though…because all of the sailor girls were princesses from different planets who were sent to Earth to protect it…but their memories were erased when they were born in Earth**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

cool

Naota says:

**or the object can be a person**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

so anyway, I think our Quest should be something obscure, like for instance:

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

“What are you guys lookin’ for?”

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

"Oh, I don’t know really…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

"You can tell me

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

“Okay…so, I heard tales in the Village, that there is a great Power of sorts in the East…but considering the fact these are old people, it’s probably somewhere else…So, we’re NOT going East!”

Naota says:

**LOL**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

you like, ja?

Naota says:

**hmmm…the only thing I don’t like about it is how you say the “village” and in the “east”…it makes it sound too mideval and LotR-ish**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ok, fine…"in the MEGALOPOLIS WITH GODZILLA DESTOYING IT, that there is a great GENERIC WONDER IN A BOX of sorts IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EARTH

Naota says:

**lol**

Naota says:

**did you just make that up?**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yes

Naota says:

**are you being sarcastic?….I can’t tell online…but it might be because of the caps…but might not be because it is funny none-the-less**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

it was more of sarcasm

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

except for the IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EARTH part

Naota says:

**yeah…I wasn’t too crazy about the godzilla part…but then again since it’s the middle of the earth the megatropolis doesn’t matter…which makes it funnier**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

indeed, but we could use the middle of the earth part…a part of the Quest

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

they would have to take the Highway to Hell first

Naota just sent you a Nudge!

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

wake up man

Naota is inviting you to start Checkers. Do you want to accept (Alt+C) or decline (Alt+D) the invitation?

You have accepted the invitation to start Checkers.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

imagonna-killyou

Naota winks:

Naota winks:

*Play “Water Balloon”*

Naota says:

**ooooh**

Naota says:

**right in the FACED**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

oh, my face!!!

Naota says:

**FACE***

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

Hoover dam!

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

so…checkers is not working

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ok, so what do you think about the Highway idea

Naota says:

**hmmmm….I don’t know why checkers isn’t working**

Naota says:

**what does it say on your side?…mine says waiting for your buddy’s response**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

it says “Checkers is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.”

Naota says:

**well…let’s try again**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ok

Naota is inviting you to start Checkers. Do you want to accept (Alt+C) or decline (Alt+D) the invitation?

You have accepted the invitation to start Checkers.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

do it again

Naota says:

**what?…it didn’t work?**

Naota says:

**mine worked….I got farther than the time before…I even pressed start game**

Naota says:

**okay…whatever**

Naota is inviting you to start Checkers. Do you want to accept (Alt+C) or decline (Alt+D) the invitation?

You have accepted the invitation to start Checkers.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

it doen’t like m

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ee

Naota says:

**fine…forget it**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

thank you

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

How do you like the Highway to Hell bit, do you think it would fly

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

?

Naota says:

**hmmmm…how about it’s a highway to hell…and there are towns and cities along the way**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yes…and whenever they travel along the Highway for the first time, the ACDC song plays

Naota says:

**LOL**

Naota says:

**I knew that was coming**

This activity or game is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

and every time they get back on it, a different version of the song plays

Naota says:

**okay…now what can we add to it? They are going to the center of the Earth because they heard of an old myth that says that there is a generic wonder in a box.**

Naota says:

**but they are demon cities**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yes…and no

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

if we went with a modified version of Dante’s model, we could have whole communitites of just regular dead people

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

we could have all sorts of other mythical creatures too

Naota says:

**yeah…I wasn’t limiting it to demons**

Naota says:

**and that’s how we could incorporate the other anime’s…each town has it’s own task that could correspond to an anime show…that is if we are still going in the spoof genre…cause I actually think this could new idea could hold up by itself**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

we could do both…a storyline with gags from other anime

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

like, only half the cities are spoofs, or something similar

Naota says:

**okay**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

get it away

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ok, so…charactors…I agree that the main charactor should be female

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

a companion would be good too

Naota says:

**yeah…one of those really tall skinny ones**

Naota says:

**that tend to appear so often in anime**

Naota says:

**companion….**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

but she eats a whole lot

Naota says:

**YES**

Naota says:

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

and a cow noise happens everytime a meal ends

Naota says:

**when the meal starts**

Naota says:

**open word and start writting this down**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ok

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

we can save this conversation you know

Naota says:

**yeah…but that’s alot of extra into to go through**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ok, word opened, “When the meal starts…”

Naota says:

**no I mean I think it would be more fitting to have the cow noise when she starts eating than at the end**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ok

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

definately

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

I agree

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

and we can add various other livestock noises as we please

Naota says:

**okay…should it just be her and her companion and the different people they encounter? Or should it be a group of like…5 or 6…like a team…going to get the box?**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

I think that we should have only two to begin with, and she encounters more people along the way…the straitforward stuff. But we could twist it in this fashion: Only a few of them stay for more that a few towns. We could have “hitch hiker” charactors that only need to get to one particular place. Depending on the individual, that charactor could be helpful, harmful, or just plain worthless.

Naota says:

**cool**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

eventually, we’ll formulate a “team” with the quality charactors

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

this is a good session. I like what we have here

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

hopefully these ideas are used in some compasity

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

so…we got the ‘team’ format, the location, the central character…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

what else?

Naota says:

**make up the legend of the box?**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yes…"ONCE UPON AN AGE…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

A GREAT something or other WAS FORMED!

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

I think maybe something a little less dramatic?

Naota says:

**okay**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

"Once upon an age, a great many of the Old Gods went to get cocktails

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

The bartender was a great Usurper, bent on the destruction of the Good that the Old Gods had formed.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

the Usurper wasn’t invited to the Premier due to a clerical error, and he hates walking into a Show late.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

–you’re turn, steve

Naota says:

**uuhhhmmm…k…hold on…**

Naota says:

**what’s an Usuper?**

Naota says:

**Usurper***

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

if I remember correctly, ‘one who disrupts power’, usually used in a negative context, as in, an usurper would be one to stage a millitary coup to gain politcal power

Naota says:

**okay**

Naota says:

**However none of the other Gods knew how to make cocktails, therefore ruining their dinner plans.**

Naota says:

**Assuming that since the Bartender God didn’t show up that he must be plotting revolution, the Gods created a military base to defend themselves against him.**

Naota says:

**Since the people of Earth didn’t want to give up their alcohol privlages, they backed up the Bartender God and the great war of Molotov began.**

Naota says:

**–your turn Sam**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

nice

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

So, it was a great conflict betwixt the Old Gods and the Usurper and People.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

People generally got killed. The Old Gods generally didn’t.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

The Usurper, on the other hand, had the greatest cocktail dessert of them all: the Usurper’s Sipper-Upper.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

With the ultimate proof of the Usurper’s Sipper-Upper, the Good was soiled, and the Show wasn’t going to go on after all.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

but then…(steve, do you want to add anything?)

Naota says:

**I can’t think of anything**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ok, cause I got the finisher…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

Right before the Usurper took the fatal drink…just at the moment when all People would die…the New Gods on the Block showed up.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

“Where did you come from?” the Usurper asked. “Where did YOU come from?” the New Gods did say, and that was that.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

The New Gods, being so increadibly new, still had much the likeness of small children. Since everyone can’t resist cute children, they convinced everybody to stop the fighting, the killing, and for Molotov’s Sake don’t drink the Sipper-Upper, Usurper!

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

And so, it was told that the drink was poured out into the sky, which became the stars, but…the glass was Uberglass, and so it could not be destroyed.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

And so, with everyone’s Lawyer present, the Uber-Cocktail-glass was placed in a box, in the middle of the Earth…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

“What, you want the Glass?” “Yes, wouldn’t you? Can you imagine the kind of cocktails that think could hold?!”

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

whattya think? a little not funny enough?

Naota says:

**hmmm….it’s good….it’s kinda out there….how do I say this….it’s good, but I’m not like, “OMG that is the best that is what we are using,” because I think something better could come along…but it’s good for now and all practical purposes**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yes, I think that the BIG session, if we would use the concept, would come up with a better legend

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

well, what about the compainion

Naota says:

**well…since the girl is already tall…it would be sensible that he/she/it will be a small one**

Naota says:

**like a midget creature thingy**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

with really beady eyes

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

like dots

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

or maybe, elonged dots, but really beady.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ima thinking big ears for some reason

Naota says:

**a raccoon or fox like thing**

Naota says:

**with a vest**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

with three tales

Naota says:

**and a fez**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

it has monkey arms and legs, though

Naota says:

**….?**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

like, opposable thumbs, and crap like that

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

useable arms and legs

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

combination of long and short fur, depending on body design

Naota says:

**well yeah…usuable…I didn’t mean that animalish…I just meant that’s what it would look like…it would still stand on 2 legs and have usuable arms…I thought it was implied**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

oops

Naota says:

**I thought you meant with monkey arms like really long lanky monkey arms**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

no, that’s one of it’s transformations

Naota says:

**I like the transformation idea**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

and it will have a satchel that it will store things in, like trinkets and such

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

The trinkets will be key to transformation

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

Once it will use a trinket, it will absorb into its flesh and thus the transformation occurs

Naota says:

**okay…so it’s not an actual ability of his**

Naota says:

**or her**

Naota says:

**s**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

well, I personally think that this character (we will refer to it as the Familiar) has a very mysterious backround, perhaps even in connection with the Molotov War, or something even more bizzare. Plus, the trinkets are only there to control the shape of the transformation, otherwise the Familiar would just turn to mush

Naota says:

**I was thinking the sidekick wouldn’t be a very serious and mysterious character…but a more light-hearted almost puny character**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

well, its more like, for instance, the Familiar is that way, only because he has had enough of whatever intrugies the Familiar was in before. Essentially, the Familiar abanded being a serious character for a silly one

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

Bits of its former life creep in every once in a while, but only at the most important times

Naota says:

**okay…almost like the Familiar just tries not the think about that **

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yes, preciecly

Naota says:

**Oh, idea! **

Naota says:

**if the Familiar was had some connection to the war that would imply the Familiar is old…I think it might be more fitting and better explain the split personality if we have that Familiar have a past life in the war…**

Naota says:

**do you know what I mean?**

Naota says:

**like how people died in the civil war in their past lives?**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

He was reincarned with his memories…

Naota says:

**OH! THAT’S HOW WE CAN DO A SPOOF OF YUGI-OH!**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

haha

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

nice

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

We could make this more interesting, and have a whole race of people that the Familiar belongs to, and that could be a racial ability.

Naota says:

**more like a curse**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yeah…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

And they only could reproduce when lovers find each other again

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

and they always go through a period of personalities…like ‘phases’, only they’re lifelong

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

or multiple life long

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

hmm…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

The Tribe of Fezt’Nik

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

mercenaries during the Molotov War…would fight for either side, and…made hotdog stands in the middle of traffic. Unforgivable, they were cursed…

Naota says:

**lol**

Naota says:

**it’s unforgivable because they were made out of turkey and not beef**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

say it isn’t so!

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

They deserved it

Naota says:

**oh…but the race is sort of merchant like as well**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

some of them

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

Let see…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

we seem to have three lifestyles for Fezt’nik…merchants, mercenaries, and hobos (our character)

Naota says:

**lol**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

Some of them are deviant, and try to do good deeds, but they can’t; another part of the curse

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

Something always goes wrong.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

(that, incidentally, could be a major part of the plot: “Hey, why aren’t you helping me?” “I can’t…”)

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

well, maybe not all good deeds…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

like, purely humanitarian things…or something…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

brb

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

what do you think about that, steve

Naota says:

**hmmm…how about when they try to do good deads they usually don’t work out like you said…but when it really matters the Familiar is able to come through**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yeah…or maybe it’s just a character flaw, not a curse-related bit…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

but the curse would always be blamed

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

or combination of both…with fried rice and an egg roll

Naota says:

**how about not the whole race has the curse**

Naota says:

**just him**

Naota says:

**her**

Naota says:

**the Familiar**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

just it…and maybe some of his “friends”? They wouldn’t even have to be the same physiology…they all have some sort of brand that they all bear…what about that?

Naota says:

**ehhh…I don’t know about that**

Naota says:

**oh the egg roll and fried rice reminded me of this comedian I saw…he was talking about new school supplies and one that he made up was the Pocket Asian.**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

lol…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

I gave up on the “friends” idea, that detracts from the uniquess that the Familiar would have with this curse

Naota says:

**and it was HIS show…so they were able to act out all that stuff…he was sitting at his desk then an asian kids head came out of his backpack and he asked the asian “what’s the square root of 20736?” “144! And you forgot to carry the 1 on the problem on the left” “Thanks Pocket Asian…here’s a spring roll…” “spring roll not included”**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

LOL

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

nice

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

I want a Pocket Asian

Naota says:

**another was the calculator for smart kids…“When you’re older being smart is sexy…but in high school it’s embarrasing. To avoid those harrasing bullies just use the bully-away calculator”**

Naota says:

**a caclulator with an electic shocker at the end like a cattle prod**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

haha

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

typing?

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

i’ll take that as a ???

Naota says:

**“and also don’t forget our pimple mase!” He squeezes a pimple and liquid shoots at the bully and he falls down and screams**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

I hate it when that happens

Naota says:

**wow…that almost makes up for the fact that you’ll graduate a virgin**

Naota says:

**nerdy kid looks depressed**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

haah…do we want to get back on track?

Naota says:

**sure**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ok…so we have Hell as our location…what sort of physical laws do we have here?

Naota says:

**uhhh…..I was thinking it would be normal.**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ok…but like…magic and stuff…

Naota says:

**oh…uh…this could be the Full Metal Alchemist spoof**

Naota says:

**they have like circles and things like that to transform things…or pieces of paper with symbols that with an incantation can do something (sailor moon)…or a very powerful sword (inuyasha)…**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ok…so, we have the transformation trinkets (lets say that the Familiar makes them of his own handiwork), we have magick weapons, magick scrolls…cool.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

We can use magic circles with pretty much anything, really…or maybe not. I don’t know; too many possibilities here

Naota says:

**uhm…there’s also just the normal supernatural power…being able to control a certain element**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

oh, that stuff, too…

Naota says:

**psychic powers**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

hmm…how conventional should we be?

Naota says:

**conventional?**

Naota says:

**what do you have in mind?**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

ima thinking…good twists on old ideas.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

for instance, instead of controlling an element, commanding an Elemental spirit/monster temporarily, or instead of a magic scroll, use a enscribed stone…stuff like that

Naota says:

**the monster think is like what happens on Archon (remember that NES game of mine?)**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yeah!!!…and not just limited to elements, either. If a particular city on the Highway is filled with garbage, you could have a garbage elemental…just a hint of Shinto…

Naota says:

**yeah**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

Depending on what the substance is, the Elemental exists for that long…maybe even for a few episodes…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

its always possible…for a permanent elemental…hmmm…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

i don’t know about that

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

And the magic stones bit…that could work that into the Yu-gi-oh! spoof…“You must play this game of Mysic Marbles!”

Naota says:

**Pokemon spoof for the summoning of monsters!**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yes…yes…we have created a monster!

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

AHhh

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

!

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

indeed…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

and we could have the Magick Cricket bat

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

or something like that

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

I know! Another magical process…MUSIC!

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

different kinds of music produce various effects

You have just sent a Nudge!

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

WAKE UPP!

Naota says:

**NO**

Naota says:

**NOT MUSIC**

Naota says:

**NO**

Naota says:

**It’s too similar to the FFX-2 dessphere songstress…that was so dumb**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

huh?

Naota says:

**in FFX-2 there is a job that entails dancing to inflict darkness, silence, poison, etc onto your enemy or boosting your own stats…it was the dumbest occupation ever created on FFX**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

That is DANCE, not MUSIC. I was thinking more along the lines of Zelda, with the Ocarina and all…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

by the way, if at any point in time that we should stop, just say so…

Naota says:

**oh**

Naota says:

**I’m just doing homework until my roommate goes to sleep….**

Naota says:

**do you have class tomorrow?**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

not important ones. My English class is watching a movie I have already seen. I practically sleep in that class anyway.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

and there are quiet places to take naps

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

its great

Naota says:

**Sam….don’t treat ECC like HS…you must utilize it’s resources Sam…utilize…**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

I am….the nap area is going to be cool

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

haha

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

don’t worry, really.

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

I haven’t felt sleepy this whole time, and this chat was and still is definately worth it

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

Well, anyway…so, maybe a magic flute, or a harp, or magic bagpipes?

Naota says:

**I like the bagpipes…**

Naota says:

**or maybe a digeriedoo**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yes…

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

I can see it now…Our Questing adventurers happen upon a mystical band with bagpipes, finger cymbals, and a digeriedoo

Naota says:

**LOL**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

they are definately part of the “team”…or not

Naota says:

**the band…they can follow for a while…but I think it would be alittle motonous and annoying after a while…they could spoof from the FFX band in Macalania Woods**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

they could

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

yes, and they have mystical powers, but only when they find Sylva’s Socerous Songbook (a guide for the inexperienced musicmancer, 5th edition). that can be their reason for hitch hiking.

Naota says:

**lol**

Adrod akra dee dingku’ni ir says:

wow…now ima starting to drift off…i think ima gonna go now…ima saving this conversation, maybe gleen out the useful information later on…
