# Droid Teachers

I think that the observation about droid teachers and that sort of thing
is a socioeconomic status thing. Everyone is guaranteed a right to an
education, and if students can't afford to go to a paid school, then
they are provided with an android teacher. However, most affluent
students go to paid schools that offer biological instructors, and
typically have artificial tutors for every student. Harriet has one of
these tutors, but prefers to study with Saavitte. Saavitte has a better
relationship to her tutor, but often has to enter commands in a funny
way because a programming spell backfired on her, and how she has to
deal with workarounds. She helped get Harriet started on her football
scores program, but they were both impressed that Harriet was able to
get most of the work done by herself. If only this was a school
assignment, every assignment. Then Harriet would have no trouble going
pro.
