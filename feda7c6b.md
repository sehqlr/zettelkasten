# Chapter 2

The park was particularly sunny that day. It had been overcast for the
past week, with the meterologists calling for scattered showers, and at
one point in time, golfball sized hail. However, nothing of these
miniweather disasters came to pass, and all was peaceful in the city.

The city park was bursting with energy, despite the less than warm as it
usually is in summer temperatures. A few families, waiting for the sun
to appear, decided, what the hell, it was time for a little bit of
outside rest and relaxation, and decided to have what the park-goers
collectively decided to call the event an “overcast picnic.”

The children of a particularly boring middle-aged couple– the kind of
couple that shouldn’t be having kids this late in their lives, but hey,
her doctor told her that she could have them, and they’d been married a
few times before with no children, so why not? Having youth around keeps
you youthful, so why not pop out a few? We’ve got enough money. Who
cares what the people at work say?– were playing frisbee with an
incredibly shaggy dog.

This dog was pretty shaggy. The shags go down to the ground off of his
legs, and the shaggy hair covered the eyes pretty regularly. In those
types of dogs, you never know how they see anything, or even if they’re
looking. This dog seemed to want to chase the frisbee being thrown
pretty readily though. It had a lot of energy. The kids kept calling the
dog “he” because the nametag on the collar said “Luc”.

While Luc was playing with those kids, Jill was Contemplating the
newspaper.
