raised attached segment zettel-content"><h1>Dragon</h1><div class="pandoc"><p>Once upon a time, a normal couple had a son. They named him Jacob Arthur; they called him Jack. They roared to amuse him, and he roared back. When he walked (finally), they gave Jack crayons. He drew shapeless figures. They asked him what the shapeless figures were. He told them that they were “dwagons.” Jack drew dragons: red dragons on poster board, black dragons on yellow construction paper, faint dragons on the dark kitchen cabinet doors, blue dragons on the drywall, and orange dragons on the patio chairs. Furniture, walls, floors—nothing was safe from the blunt wax, nothing undragoned. His mother wasn’t too happy when she found green-and-purple scorch marks on her brand new refrigerator. His parents were dumbfounded—Dragons! Dragons? Can’t he like normal things, like GI Joe and firecrackers?</p><p>Jack’s crayons were taken away.</p><p>Jack drew dragons in a notebook. He drew dragon-themed comic strips in the long morning ride to school, between classes, during classes. He drew dragons eating geometric figures on his math homework. He drew dragons fighting to impress his few friends. He drew dragons hugging each other to impress girls. He drew dragons from the penises that invaded his often-stolen notebook. He drew dragons on thank you cards, Christmas cards, birthday cards. He was voted “Most Artistic,” but only because he was always covered in paint.</p><p>Near the end of his senior year, his high school had a contest. Jack labored long hours on his oily masterpiece: a mural-long serpentine dragon with wings, claws, and fire. Knights were in the corner, doomed. The scales were iridescent, too; he had spent extra money for this. He hardly survived the week following up the event with all of the art that was flowing onto his canvas.</p><p>The first place winner was a three-perspective Cubist pigeon. Jack got a participation award.</p><p>The award was burned. The drawing, the painting, it all stopped. He started to read. He read fantasy novels and art books. He read them by the day. He could walk from the bookstore to his bus stop and read without tripping on the uneven pavement. He met Morgan, a woman working at the bookstore. She read fantasy, too. He introduced himself as Arthur. They talked about fantasy topics at first, but then it went elsewhere, like the dragon tattoo on his back, his bare, shirtless back. Three months after, they started playacting– he was a dragon, pillaging her village. Arthur took up painting again, trying to fill up books this time. Dragons were always in the forefront, with human props. Morgan advised that he do other subjects too whenever he wanted to get published.</p><p>Arthur never sold his books to anybody.</p><p>Arthur and Morgan bought a house. Morgan got him a job at the bookstore, and they climbed the store’s ladders together. INSERT Eventually, Arthur and Morgan had two kids, Alice and Thomas. When Arthur first introduced his dragon art books to her, Alice said that dragons were cool, but she would rather hang out with unicorns– they were less greedy and better groomed. Arthur couldn’t draw unicorns, and all of the stories that featured them were waste-basketed. When it came time for his son to be exposed, Thomas thought dragons were old and dead. He wanted to play with things that were “now.”</p><p>Arthur bought him GI Joe and firecrackers.</p><p>Arthur’s head balded in the usual way, and his suitcase for work was gold-tipped, but Arthur had no fire about him anymore. He was walking rigor mortis. Years past. Arthur retired, Morgan died; Alice and Thomas visited sometimes, moreso when they had grand kids to bring.</p><p>When the grand kids were older, he didn’t show them his unpublished art books.</p><p>Jacob Arthur’s old age twisted him; he didn’t have much time. Jacob Arthur wanted to stand on his own. He wanted to walk to his old house and see all of his grand-kids and give them crayons and poster board. But mainly, he wanted dragon things. He wanted to roar. He wanted to live in a remote cave, jealous of his treasure horde. He wanted to fly and survey his well-deserved kingdom. He wanted to pillage Morgan like he used to when she was alive– hell, he wanted to pillage all those young nurses that handled his medical bags. He wanted them all, giggling. He wanted knights to come to the rescue; he’d crush them in his powerful claws. He wanted to feast upon those knights. He wanted to be better than their swords and horses. He wanted to be better than unicorns. He wanted to be better than GI Joe and firecrackers. He wanted to be better than that stupid three-perspective Cubist pigeon. He wanted to breathe fire, even as a child making green-and-purple scorch marks on the refrigerator. He wanted to breathe that fire and be that fire forever.</p><p>Jacob Arthur was soon buried. No mention of dragons.</p></div><div class="metadata"><div class="date" title="Zettel date"><time datetime="2020-11-24T13:21">2020-11-24</time></div></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized backlinksPane"><h3 class="ui header"><span title="Backlinks from folgezettel parents">Uplinks</span></h3><ul class="backlinks"><li><span class="zettel-link-container folge"><span class="zettel-link" title="2020-11-23T14:45"><a href="113a7ff2.html">Writing Index</a><span data-nosnippet="" style="user-select: none; color: gray" title="Folgezettel">#</span></span></span><ul class="context-list" style="zoom: 85%;"></ul></li></ul></nav><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;age/university&#39;">age/university</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;writing/homework&#39;">writing/homework</span><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="See all zettels tagged &#39;writing/story&#39;">writing/story</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.17.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
