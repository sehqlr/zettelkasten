The new plan was diabolical, even more so than the original diabolical
plan. Who was the dark wizard that came up with this plan to the

The plan was to take a sample of an alien species, also known as
kidnapping one of them, and then casting the sympathetic spell that will
link that alien with all other aliens of that same species.
