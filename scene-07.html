class="zettel-view"><article class="ui raised attached segment zettel-content"><div class="pandoc"><h1 id="title-h1">Chapter 7</h1><p>Anyway, does Harriet have any pets. Do any of the characters have any pets? Well, in Star Wars, the droids have become the pets of the people, at least the BB units are like dogs. I’m not sure if that’s endearing or insulting to the droids. I guess it depends on their personality. It comes from treating them as subhuman. I think that androids in this story should also have some kind of oppression going on, one that gets mitigated by the Rebellion. Like, androids joining the Rebellion are treated more like people than they are if they were to stay in the Empire where they are subjugated. That kind of thing interest me. Like in the Robot novels, how robots are evolving to be something more than they are, especially when they develop the zeroth law of robotics. Are there any laws of robotics in this universe? I think that in this case, magic has gifted the androids with some kind of intelligence that is different from humans, but it still a form of intelligence. Can you gift a thing personhood with magic? Can you instill sapience with a spell? I think that if you have an intelligent agent, I mean intelligent agent, with a thinking spell that goes on for two long, you can have personality develop as a side effect of having an intelligent agent around for a long time. How long depends on the individual thing. Like the snitch of the old earth game quiddich, you can have personality develop in inanimate objects. And because androids are programmable, that gives it a better chance of developing. In Star Wars, if an astromech droid is allowed to keep developing a personality, they will, and the way to fix it is a memory wipe. I think that the same mechanics happen here, where the Empire constantly wipes its androids, the Rebellion finds that it can liberate androids by programming them and then allowing them to develop personalities. They become less efficient, but they do become more personable and revolutionary. They will start to sacrifice their lives in order to complete their missions, just as readily as their organic counterparts. Whereas the androids under the Empire will allow themselves to be destroyed only if ordered to.</p><p>Also, do dragons exist in this world? Yes, they are a protected species that have zoos dedicated to having dragons in captivity, they are no longer a wild threat. They were almost wiped out by humanity, but it took a great deal of conservation effort to get dragons out of endangerment and into simply vulnerable. Humans are notorious for killing off apex predators other than themselves of course, so that should come to no surprise that dragons nearly went extinct by the hand of humans too. Especially since it was believed that their body parts were valuable medicines. Just like rhinos, really. Now, there are other dragon like creatures on other planets, and those have been caged up too, except for a certain species of Blightwyrm that was just too dangerous to live. They caused problems by waging psychological warfare on any humanoid species that tried to control them. They had to be wiped out, and magic researchers have been trying to de-extinct them ever since, There could be some kind of story plotline there, but I’m not sure what it’d be, besides some kind of story about how the Empire used Blightwyrms to attack and subjugate people. Part of their secret war crimes, perhaps? Like, there was a program to use them to kill people, the researchers went wrong with it and all got killed themselves?</p><p>Another question: does this universe contain animagus magic users? Like are there people that can transform to animals? Sure they can, and nowadays it is mostly alien animals that people can transform into. It turns out that the distribution of animagus seems relatively universal. There’s a percentage of the magic user populace that have the ability to transform into one animal form. Each person usually transforms into a species native to their planet, although rarely they can take on the form of a different sort of thing. There was once a wizard that could transform into a bucket. That wizard wasn’t good as a bucket, that’s what happened. It wasn’t a useful skill, but it came in handy when he wanted to avoid his spouse.</p><p>And why do I get this weird feeling in my stomach that I’m going to be sick into something? Maybe that wizard that can only transform into a bucket would be a help here. That wizard is named Buckly, ironically. Buckly the Bucket Wizard is a common refrain from his childhood. But wow, he was able to turn into the thing that he was getting made fun of to do, that must mean something, right? I think that this character is going to be a joke character that people know from a holovid sitcom or something, not a thing that actually exists in the world of the story. I think that is an acceptable idea and I’m going to use it somehow. Probably during the early part of the story and then have a weird callback to it in dialog.</p><p>They could have a conversation about losing teeth when a Force Sensitive character talks about a dream they had where they tell the future. That could be interesting. At least, it could be interesting as long as I don’t over do it. I could easily fall into some dumb tropes if I’m not careful. I’ll need to do some reading on tvtropes to avoid or lampshade and subvert tropes. That could be a fun, a trope busting story? Especially if it’s a fan fic of two fandoms being smashed together. I could subvert all kinds of ideas. I could make this not a young adult story, and make it a full adult story will all kinds of subversive ideas. I’m not sure how subversive young adult material can be. I could try really hard to be a lighthearted subversive, like funny instead of weird and sexual, which is my first thought when i think of subversive.</p><hr /><p>Well, as I don’t like religion much, I’m inclined to make the Force less of a religious thing and more of a science thing. Like, the idea is that the Force is a part of magic that is not well understood, and that’s why it’s mysterious, and that people make it into a cult-like thing but it’s not necessary, it’s just something that people don’t understand, and there’s no way to be empirical about it. Well, at least, there’s no way to be rational about it, and the only empirical thing that can be said about it is that some people are more sensitive to the intuition than others, and that’s where we get our prophecies from. All divinationists are trying to get their information from their Intuition, not everyone has the same level of connection to the Force, so there are still fraudsters out there tricking people, but there are also people who genuinely have it and aren’t faking it. I think that is a good enough thing about it. Although I can keep with the star wars theming and turn it into a cult for some and a scientific endeavor for others. I just want to make my world have shades of gray in it, instead of just good and evil like both star wars and harry potter have. I also want to break down gender and sex barriers in the famdoms too, but I think that I’ve got some good ideas for that already, and I just need to do some research so I don’t offend people with my ignorance. I know that I don’t know things, and that’s okay. There are tricky subjects that we must all grapple with, and this is one of them. I’m going to become a better ally by the process of writing this book, and I’m glad for the feedback that I have already gotten. I think that it’s going to be an important work, even if it never gets published.</p><p>Wow, my life. It has been quite a journey here, hasn’t it? It started so poorly, and it slowly gets better and better. I’m hopeful that soon we’ll be able to have me working somewhere again, contributing to the family in a fiscally positive way, in a way that also respects me and my needs. I think that once there is a coronavirus vaccine, I will start to work somewhere, nearly anywhere, just to get my hands back into the mix, to start building up my confidence again. Then again, if I get this DevOps job with Wash U, that will change a lot of things for me, for the better, and I really hope that they offer it to me. I’m trying to be hopeful, but I’m so discouraged at this point I don’t know what to do anymore, besides just keep trying I guess.</p><hr /><p>Well, this was it. This was the moment that hey were all waiting for. She just had to jump towards the lever, pull it down, and grab onto the portkey when it apparated in. There was no way that she would have enough time to get another chance at this, this was the proverbial it.</p><hr /><p>She didn’t consciously try to time it in any particular way. Like in football, she followed her instinct. And she leapt for it. A ball wizzed past her face as she tried the lever. It was not well oiled, it seemed, because it wasn’t moving. Harriet pulled with all her might, but it wasn’t budging. And she was caught in the middle of a crossfire, and it was only a matter of time until someone fired at her. She was a sitting duck, and she was pulling the lever has hard has she could. There was no telling how long it was going to take to get this lever moving, but it was going to need to be now.</p><p>And she ran out of time. She could see one of the armada officers turn his laser wand towards her, and fire. Just as the bolt of energy was about to hit her, a football flew right into the line of fire and absorbed the blast. It changed direction, and hit the lever with a massive boost of speed, allowing it to move finally. After Harriet made sure that the lever was all the way down, she dove into her hiding spot where she was before.</p><p>“Now what?” she shouted.</p><p>“It’s going to take a second for the manual override to charge enough to activate the portkey spell,” Tobial said, “once it appears, we jump for it.”</p><p>The port key appeared. It was exactly like the last one that was destroyed by a random football, except not destroyed like the one that was hit by a random football. It had eight handles on it.</p><p>“Go go go!” Q’nall said, and all of them jumped out to grab onto the portkey. Eenee cast a defensive spell to redirect an energy blast, then grabbed the portkey the last one to do so.</p><p>“Hang on!” Tobial said, and they vanished from the station. They were surrounded by wildlife now, surrounding a small pavilion.</p><p>“this doesn’t look like an official imperial transfer station,” Q’nall said.</p><p>“They renovated it. They were getting complaints that the aesthetic didn’t match the surrounding community.”</p><hr /><p>There’s one thing that they got right in the future: toilets. There were no gendered toilets in the whole of the Empire. You went in, did your business, and left. After washing your hands of course. And there laser bidets in every stall. That was the excellent thing about the future: no matter how dire things got, you had the right to a good toilet. I’m pretty sure it’s in their constitution or whatever Empires have these days. Since it’s harry potter, probably some magical scroll or some thing. Made out of parchment, like all official documents are still made out of parchment, but because animal skin is a precious resource, they make it artificially, like cultured beef or something, but really it’s artificial parchment that all official documents have to be on. That’s the kind of procedural detail that fans want we know this from the prequel trilogy for star wars. We want to see politicians make decisions, it’s super riveting and not at all a betrayal of the action adventure spirit of the original movies Now what was I talking about, oh yes, toilets. Harriet used the toilet of course, because she was a biological organism, but we aren’t really going to go into detail because this is not one of those stories that would go into detail. But I just wanted to mention it. The Empire is not completely evil, just mostly evil. They may commit genocide but at least the toilets are great! TM.</p><p>I wonder what the future of space travel will really be like if magic was real. But then, since this is a story I can make it up and it’s true™ wow, lots of those jokes right now, did you watch a bunch of commercials or something? Anyway, good toilets are a part of space travel, so that’s definitely staying in. Another thing about spaceships in the magical future is that artificial gravity is totally a thing and that you don’t have to worry about losing muscle mass or anything like in microgravity because in magic space, there is always a down. There is also no need for a pure oxygen environment, there is a normal Earth atmosphere in each ship, they have no restrictions on smoking or whatever, so wizards can fill up their bongs and rip it in space, because what else are you going to do on the long trips? Surveys, don’t make me laugh, they are definitely smoking weed every day all day. That’s what I would do if I were an astronaut, which is probably one of the many reasons why I’m not one.</p><p>Anyway, so magic space travel is pretty safe and fast, because they invented the appration drive. which allows for ships to teleport.</p><hr /><p>There were no ninjas anywhere in the place, at least according to initial scans, but then again, you never know. They were sneaky, future ninjas. For one thing, they were actually wizards most of the time, so they weren’t ordinary ninjas. They were magininjas. Second thing about them, is that they used magitechnology whenever possible, so they were like, I don’t know, cyberpunk? But they were ninjas in a magical space future, so they weren’t 80’s cyberpunk, they were Harry Potter cyberpunk, which is a completely new genre that I just made up. Anyway, so these magical cyberpunk space ninjas were the most feared assassins in the Empire. They were especially hard to hire; pretty much the only person that could afford them these days were nobles and the Empress herself, so they were practically royal magical cyberpunk space ninjas. They were called the Sith. They descended from the deatheathers of the past, since Voldemort died and everything. They had to survive somehow, and this is how they evolved. They became ninjas, since just being dark wizards wasn’t enough for these kind of people. They were above all else, killers. And they knew how to do stealth spells, so they could sneak up on you in nearly plain sight, But they typically didn’t, they decided that they were going to kill people in the shadows so that there were less witnesses that way. Well, naturally they killed witnesses. They were famous for it, among all the other things they were famous for, like being 5 different kinds of historical pop icons at the same time. That wasn’t really that confusing to them, its just confusing to explain for the first time when you are reduced to describing things in terms of memes. These were memekillers, because one other thing they were good at was social media. So they were royalist social media gurus that were cyberpunk space ninjas. Did I get everything right yet? Can I grow the Sith into an even more ridiculous pastiche of pop culture? I don’t think so, I think that’s enough for one day. Maybe I’ll revisit them later, maybe not?</p><p>Anyway, so Tobial scanned for weird ninjas and didn’t find any evidence of them, but he wasn’t going to be careless about this. At least, not more careless than he had been. He had made so many mistakes on this journey here, but he has learned a lot. Like looking out for ninjas with scanners. And expecting things like scanners to fail in spectacular ways that will make you regret using them. He then started to look around with eyes, leaning into each nook and granny in the supply closet. once he was satisfied with his search, he started scrying the station school for the Rebellion. He had information vital to the Rebellion that he needed to rely to them to save the galaxy</p><hr /><p>The real shame of it all was that the rock n roll of the past was largely forgotten. People got tired of recordings once there was a critical mass of them. People started to demand live recordings for the holovids, so that they could have a real experience, or at least as real as they could come to a recording. Then the holonet was established later on that decade, so the demand for live performance was increased. In fact, all music in the future is performed in some way. Once you consider that androids are completely capable of playing an unlimited amount of music and that they had the intelligence to create their own compositions, people started demanding robot disk jockeys to perform digital music at all times. Most of the music that is listened to the characters in this story are in fact improvisational electro-jazz in space, so that’s something that you have to imagine now. But they like it, it’s barely jazz anyway, so don’t worry about it. One thing that is really interesting though is that there’s always singing for people that want singing, lots of improvisation for people who like that, there’s robots that are going to play the same sort of rhythm section day in and day out for people who want to listen to something interesting but not intrusive. For every person, they figure out their musical tastes by sampling what live performers want and have to perform. Most performers are either androids, which means that they are property of the Empire or whoever owns them, or they are people, which means that they work for the state of whoever happens to employ them. It’s a sort of partial patronage system, where the performers get a salary but also they can receive payments from their listeners.</p><p>A similar thing works for the stage too. In fact, there are robots that perform william shakespeare because it is public domain in rural areas of the galaxy. In fact, at this point, shakespeare is so old that you have to take lots of classes or have an artificial translator spell in your head. So most of shakespeare is spoken in the local language, there are spells that have been discovered to add rhyme and meter to spoken language, so pretty much anyone can read shakespeare. it’s a strange universe that they live in, but hey, they gotta live somewhere.</p><p>Anyway, Harriet likes punk rock that’s in the future so it’s not really punk rock but she calls it punk rock and we believe her to her face but disbelieve her behind her back. And she likes singing, and guitars, and all the other stuff. She doesn’t have much money to spend on music stuff, but when she does, it’s that one band that I made up for her in that part of the manuscript where I talked about it before. and that band gives out merch of course, so she definitely has a poster in her room next to that of Autok of (Jesus I forgot their planet’s name, oh well)</p><hr /><p>well, well, well, well, well well well well well well well well! The ninjas all said before they attacked. They were fearsome to behold. The Sith don’t mess around when it comes to intimidation. They had skull helmets on, and really cool other details on their uniforms that I might describe now since I’m try to come up with words to write for today’s challenge (I’m trying to reach 40k today, I bet you noticed but you never know) So I’m going to try to describe their uniforms. Have you ever seen the Hellboy movies? Well in the first one, there that one Von Trapp or whatever character that has that kickass uniform that I want to steal as a Halloween costume every year, but I never do because I don’t want to go as a Nazi character for Halloween, punch nazis seriously, but anyway now my mother in law is calling us talking about houses so now I can not listen to it, she is trying to move to an old people flat house that won’t have any stairs, and lots of other details that you don’t care about, really, you want to hear about how cool the Sith costumes are and how intimidating they are, and how they could kill you with magic faster than you can say Hufflepuff but now I’m just thinking about her describing the house in detail, something about fishes theme? And how her father would like it? I’m not sure, we’ll see it if she moves there but otherwise I really want to think about something else but words are words in nanowrimo and I just can’t see myself not typing out everything cause otherwise I’ll never win and I AM IN IT TO WIN IT BABYYYYYYYYYYY!</p><p>OK, she got off the phone, thank god.</p><p>Anyway, what was I talking about, oh right, the Sith. They were wearing stuff that makes them look like Daft Punk but more murdery. They carried two wands each, just in case they have a failure of a wand. But these wands were really long and thick, and could be used as bludgeoning weapons.</p><p>Oh great, it’s John Denver playing, and now I’m thinking about getting Rocky Mountain High. I’m trying to focus here!</p><p>So, the Sith were deadly. The rumors were that you never escaped them once they started to chase you and hunt you down, and that no one ever survived their attacks. Of course, you may be wondering, if no one ever survived, how did they have any rumors about them? If they were that deadly, why would they have any reputation whatsoever? Does that makes sense? Well, our heroes are going to survive an attack from the Sith and try to dispel some of those rumors, so lets’ go.</p><hr /><p>Should there be a cantina scene? There’s always a cantina scene in star wars, but there is no reason why school children would go to a place like that? I mean, I know that they drink butter beer in Harry Potter, is that actually alcoholic, or is it soda? I was never really clear on that.</p><p>I SNEEZED REALLY LOUD I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW I SWEAR I’M NOT HIGH RIGHT NOW</p><p>Anayway I don’t konw if there’s going to be a cantina scene, it doesn’t make any sense in the story so far, but maybe I’ll add one in later, you know, for fun or something there should be fun in a story at least that’s what I aim for. Traditionally I do clever, not emotional. I remember I wrote a story about words being twisted around and I thought it was so good but i kinda turned into a complete disaster to read, and I am still sad about it. I thought that it was a work of genius, but it was just a piece of work.</p><p>I’m trying to think of any other iconic scenes from either of my root source documents or movies, and I’m thinking that I can’t possibly remember all of the iconic scenes, so I’ll just try to remember some of them.</p><p>There’s the Harry Potter scene were Harry gets his wand for the first time, maybe that can be in this story since Harriet can get a wand, but it should be mixed with the first lightsaber scene because I’m mashing those two concepts together, a laser wand. By the way, I think that I’m going to eliminate the sonic wand as a concept, that was a tip of the hat in the direction of Doctor Who and since that was such a small reference, I might just delete it. I mean, who carries around two wands with them? No one, that’s who. There might be different tools that are like wands, but wands are the main tool for magic users in this universe, and since you can do magic with them, most other tools don’t make much sense, This isn’t star trek were you need a toolbox of glowsticks to fix stuff, you just need an omnitool, the laser wand, and it will help you get there as long as you know the right spell to use. You see, engineers are mostly magic users that aren’t interested in being a police officer or whatever an Auror is.</p><p>Anyway, there are many different branches of the magical economy, It isn’t like in Harry Potter, where either you work for the school, the ministry, or don’t have a job. Or in star wars, where either you are an imperial officer, a criminal, or a rebellion member. There are lots of jobs in this universe, because I think about this sort of thing all the time and it makes me happy.</p><hr /><p>Do they have money in the Empire? Well of course, both Harry Potter and the Star Wars are capitalistic, and both of them have money. Now in star wars, they have imperial credits, but there’s no indication that there is any kind of physical money, I don’t think. I think that there’s something like chits, I don’t know but it seems fairly abstract. Then in Harry Potter, they have a gold, silver, and copper based economy run by goblins, which may or may not be antisemitic. Probably antisemitic. Anyway, They definitely have money. SO there is money in this story too. It should be something like the gold, I think, kinda like gold-pressed latinum in Star trek ferengi society. Something shiny something easy to steal and spend. I think that a credit is worth some amount of precious metal. Yeah, I like the idea of a space empire being on the gold standard, that seems funny to me, like there was no way that blockchain could work in space in something? Or I could introduce something like that for certain things. Or I could just kinda abstract it away to the reader, like Star Wars does, where you don’t really think about it in concrete terms, there’s just an assumption that there’s money and that it is spent. I mean the rebellion buys weapons and ships from companies that exclusively sell to the rebellion because none of the ships are the same. At least in Star Trek the Maquis use the same Federation technology, because that makes narrative sense, and in star wars, they should have completely different ships since they all operate with the same weapons dealers, but I’m having a big digression that I cannot sustain in an entertaining way. I’m here to entertain you, and I don’t think that you want to hear me go on a rant of how star wars is mostly all looks and no story, and how star trek is so much better because it isn’t just show it’s also story but this isn’t what you want is it? No you want to read fan fiction that’s a cross over between star wars and harry potter, which is what it says on the tin, isn’t it? Well, I ran out of scenes so this is what you get, y’all. Good thing this isn’t a stream like I thought I was going to do because I’d be embarrassing myself right now, and the only reason why I think I’m going to get away with it is because even though my text is in a public git repository, no one is going to read it all the way through to here, there’s just no way that’s going to happen, so I can pretty much do or say whatever I want, and I can get away with it, at least initially. And that would be presidential. At least not for long because BIDEN WON PEOPLE! WHOOOOOOOOOO</p><p>So anyway, I think that this is going to be really weird for me to edit later, and likely, this will be deleted with gusto, as much gusto as it took to write but deleting it will be much, much faster.</p><hr /><p>Wasn’t there a point in these word wars that I was talking about the Sith? Yeah, I don’t have time to look back right this moment, but I do distinctly remembering talking about them in a rather humorous way. Or at least, I was attempting humor. You can never tell until someone else observes your humor whether or not it’s actually humorous. It’s something that only can be shared, and when you laugh at your own jokes, it’s is rather hollow, isn’t it? Which is why it’s discouraged from happening in professional circles, or so I hear. Anyway, I was talking about the Sith and how they use their wands as fighting sticks too. I thought that was a pretty good touch. Since wands are just what they are encased in, it doesn’t really matter how big the thing is or where you put the crystals for it. Theoretically, you could have a laser wand that’s a shield. But that’s pretty rare, most of the time, people opt for the wand since it’s traditional sort of. Not a lot of experimentation after it as made out of metal, but that’s pretty far from the wands that were carved from special woods that were somehow tailored to your personality, or at least that’s what the harry potter website would have you believe. Well, in my universe, you made your own damn laser wand, so you can make it in whatever shape you want, as long as it’s wand shaped. They don’t allow for much experimentation wherever olivanders is in the future. Probably at the school, there would be a wand shop that helps students fashion their own laser wands, I bet there are all kinds of shops, but the wand one is the most personal, and people only visit when getting of fixing one, and otherwise, it is not a hangout spot for everyone it’s a pretty personal place, some would say sacred because the wand is a tool of magic and some people love to mix magic and religion together. No one I know personally, but they do exist, I’m sure. And if not I just made them up! Isn’t fiction the BEST?</p><p>Anyway, so the Sith have these custom short quarterstaff wands that they use to kill people. They could load up a spell to have activate on contact, and the usual counter spell techniques don’t work on someone trying to hit you with a stick, you have to know martial arts for that stuff, and not every wizard knows it. In fact, when they do fight, I think if there was any character that wasn’t going to make it, that is when they would die. Or multiple characters would die, because the Sith are the best of the best when it comes to killing people. The characters that would make it make it because they have the Force and that lets them properly fight with the Sith, which aren’t strong in the force.</p><p>Then, there are some people that would think that the Sith of course are strong with the force, they have to be. Not all Sith are Dark Jedi or Dark Wizards. Some Sith are just soldiers.</p><hr /><p>So, there was something going on with Tobial that no one could figure out. Why was he defecting exactly? He didn’t seem that forth coming to anyone else in the gang, he just seemed determined to take information to the Rebellion, and that’s it. He was a defector that didn’t really like the side that he was going to, but he had to. What they don’t know is that he definitely has attitudes about the Rebellion that are unfavorable: they are just homeless, family-less people without jobs to do. The Rebellion is painted as the cause of the desperate and the lazy, not the righteous and true. But Tobial was going to have to let go of some of those preconceptions if he is to survive his defection. It’s not like he can just go back to his old life, he was joining a new one. His family might not understand right now, but some day they will. And that was all that mattered.</p><p>He had written a coded message to each of his family members, to be read upon his death They each explained that he was sorry that he had to leave them and get killed, but he loved every one of them to the end of the universe, and that this action that he was taking was for their benefit, and not only for the benefit of the empire or the Rebellion. it was going to be a long road to recovery for them. Especially for someone who had proven loyal to the empire again and again, was it all a lie, the whole time? There was going to be a reckoning, but he didn’t care, he knew that he was right, dammit. He was right, and history was going to be on his side. He was going to be a hero of the empire in a thousand years. He even dreamed of being printed on some money some day Just picture it, his flat, uninteresting face on the 10 credit bill! hey, that should be something to see when it happens, considering that they only put the Empress onto the money these days. Maybe he could get like a stamp of something, do they still do stamps in the future? Of course, you must pay for postage, and in the future, the stamp has enough magic stored in it to perform some financial calculations to make sure that there were enough stamps on any package, which saves on postal scales.</p><p>Well, I’m almost at a 10k words for this text file, which means that my daily total is almost 10k words, which would be amazing to do, I’m going to be impressed with myself if I get to that point, that would really be something wouldn’t it?</p><p>Well, lets’ keep going. So, there is postage in the future, what about owls? I don’t think that anyone uses owls to send messages, they use the holonet to send messages. You just put your letter in the slot and it gets magicked into the other persons slot.</p><hr /><p>So, there are the Sith, are there any other organizations that the readers should know about? Well, if there are ninjas, there have to be pirates, right? So, what kind of piracy happens in space. Space pirates, space pirate kind of piracy happens in space. So, what are they like? Well, do you remember that movie Treasure Planet? Well, like that but grittier and less dog- and cat- people having babies. They were also kinda cyberpunk, because they commit holonet crime too, can’t do everything by hijacking space barges, that’s slow work and you can keep committing crime while you wait for ships to pass by. They also have aliens in their crews, because of the oppression and how space piracy is a high-risk proposition, so they take in all kinds as long as you are loyal and don’t get any friends killed, you can join a ship. And you know that they smoke weed on those ships, while they are singing their space piracy songs. It’s jolly, because that’s what pop culture expects from pirates; jolliness. Joviality. Laughter. And other positive emotions that don’t really enter a criminal lifestyle that much anymore. Not if you watch the more gritty crime shows that is. Not much laughter there.</p><hr /><p>Harriet was starting to get worried about her exams coming up by the end of the year. She was not feeling well prepared. She seemed well prepared, what, three years ago was it? It must have been, that was the last time she did exams like this. When she was passing from Grade 9 to Grade 10. The school grading system had four school levels with three grade levels within, so Grades 1 - 3 are in the Early Childhood school, Grades 4 thru 6 are in the Elementary school, Grades 7 through 9 are in the middle school, and 10 through 12 were in the high school. Or, as they were known to the Imperial citizenry, Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary Schools.</p><hr /><p>There were many levels to school in the Empire, so they decided that you could go to as many levels as you like, assuming that you pass the previous levels. Between every level of school, there is an exam that is meant to evaluate you for passage to the next level of school. If you don’t pass, then you don’t get to advance to the next level. You must stay for another year, or drop out of school. The only really important school that everyone needs in the Empire is the Primary school. That’s the period when a child is taught how to be a person. Secondary school is for learning how to be a citizen of the Empire. The Tertiary school is for learning how to be responsible. And the Quaternary school is meant to teach you how to be professional. It is the level most people need to pass in order to hold the good jobs in the Empire. But, it is also a requirement for playing zero-g football professionally. They expect professionalism on the field, not the youthful exuberance of “school soccer.” They expect that you can pass Quaternary school. Unfortunately, Harriet had a problem. She had senioritis really bad. Like so bad that if she didn’t think anyone would kill her, she would not be watching this presentation on how to give presentations. She was bored, bored bored bored. She would rather be doing nearly anything else, but especially she would not mind running laps around the pitch if it meant she never had to hear about presentations ever again. However, if you want to go pro, you have to be a pro, and this presentation is teaching you how to be a professional. Plus, you can get someone to help you review this stuff later, when you are less obsessed with running laps.</p><p>Who is this?</p><p>Your inner professional, Harriet Starr. Your inner professional.</p><p>Harriet didn’t know what the levels after Quaternary school are. Probably something to do with knowledge and service to culture, or something like that. There was no way that she was going to do any of that kind of school. There was just no way. If this was supposed to be the professional level, how much worse could it get at higher levels? Would people really start to care about learning? One way that Harriet and a lot of her football mates was to make fun of learning at every moment they could.</p><hr /><p>Football was life, as far as Harriet and her footie mates were concerned. They didn’t care much about anything else. They cared about the songs. They cared about the kicks. They cared about the goals. But mostly they cared about each other, and that’s how it should be. The station was there’s, at least, any time they weren’t playing with a different team, that would come onto the station for their home games. The Cassiopeia Catfishes weren’t any kind of fierce fighting force, but they do love their football, and Harriet was the lead adherent to this odd little religion they found themselves in.</p><p>Football was live on the holovid. Harriet couldn’t keep her eyes away. She was so focused that her voice volume control which was usually on lockdown as far as Harriet was concerned, started to become uncontrolled. She ended up waking up three dorms when she squeed at Autok’s final kick into the inner circle. She woke up all those people, when eventually, she was told to shut the hell up, by all of her dorm mates. That was the time that Harriet decided that she was going to be quiet more often, because that was really embarrassing for her.</p><p>So, she was really interested in football. It was life, and it was the best. She only had one friend that wasn’t on the football team, and that was Saavitte. Saavitte was the only nerd that Harriet wanted to hang out with. It started as a tutoring relationship, but it became a good friendship that seemed like an old one but was actually quite new. They even thought they were in love for a short time, but they decided that wasn’t going to happen, they were better friends than lovers. (Does transitioning make people feel things like love for friends? Or is that complete horseshit? I’m really high right now.)</p><p>When they became good friends, Saavitte still helped with homework and things. That was still how they spent a lot of their time, studying.</p><hr /><p>So, what else does Harriet care about? I started doing a list a while back, but I don’t remember where it is so I’m going to just wing it. Football, obviously, and that music duo. And professionalism. But she also cares about something, I’m not sure, I just kinda froze up. What does she care about that would be like something important in their society? She can’t be a climate activist, they fixed that long time ago. She can’t be a trans activist, because I’m trying to convey that it’s just not a problem anymore.</p><p>Maybe the empire isn’t turning evil, what if it’s an economic thing? Like, they need as many worlds as possible to achieve some other goal? In Ann Leckie’s trilogy, she establishes that her Empire just keeps expanding to protect their current territory. They were expansionist not entirely on purpose, or at least according to their rhetoric. I want to do something differently. I think that something about over population or something like that is what is going on. Or, it could just be that the Empress is trying to change the Empire to something else, and is succeeding. But there have to be some undercurrent for making that change possible. Hm, it could be like Germany needing land for their farms, or it could be targeting worlds that have mineral resources that the empire needs, or it could be something else entirely. But I think that the idea here is that the Empire isn’t just evil, it has a reason for doing stuff.</p><p>Or at least, a reason that makes sense to me, so I can write out their actions in a logical fashion and reason through the plot from their perspective. That way, I can have some sense of what is going on in the story, instead of just copying the plots from my sources, Harry Potter and Star Wars.</p><p>I am starting to get some kind of backache sitting in this chair again. I really should get the better chair from the basement. In some ways, I’m starting to think that it be better to bring that whole desk and computer up here to this spot I’m writing at now and just have two desks in the living room. That way, things would get utilized better. Then again, I could just make the desktop computer a web server that I manage via SSH.</p><hr /><p>I think that I would like to write something technical but really, I’m fine with writing anything. I want to be a writer, a writer is what I am. I just need to be able to really pour my feelings into my work, then I will be healed, and I will enter a new phase of my life. I am going to get through this, I will get through this, I have been through so much in my painful life and now I’m really starting to appreciate the happiness I can feel. The happiness of writing, the happiness of a safe home, a safe home at last, at long last.</p><p>That was the most vulnerable that I’ve felt on a public page in a really long time, and it was cleansing to me. I will get through this. I will.</p><p>Well, Harriet was never that vulnerable until she met Nall. They get to get together, and they stay together, through all the get-togethers. It’s a really good ending to a bad story, so far, a not great story. I’ll make it better, with time, it will be pretty good. I will let people read this, and I will let them critique it. I will be honest about my shortcomings, and I will accept the opportunity to improve myself through this process.</p><hr /><p>So, we thought that we were alone here? What do you want, Captain?</p><p>We need to start to train for our attack runs on Project Fireball. You can get to know each other better on your own time, for now I need you, Nall, to get to your ship, and for you, Harriet, to get to the safe zone. I know that you are one of us, so I trust you, as a person, but not as a pilot or an engineer. I really need you in the safe zone, now. DO you know where it is?</p><p>Yes, I know the way, said Harriet. This might have been the last that she was going to see of Nall, and she was worried that he was going to die. But duty calls, there was no way that she was going to convince him to not go. This was his life, this was his football. Fighting for the Rebellion was the best thing that he knew how to do, and it was really important that he risk his life so that others may live. The Empress’s expansionist policies must be opposed by the strongest form of protest you can have, which is a revolt.</p><p>This was going to be it. This is when I never see him again, Harriet thought. But then, she looked into his eyes across the room, and she knew, just knew, that she was going to see those eyes again. She was going to see those eyes for a long time after today. For the rest of their lives, if she had anything to do with it.</p><p>They wouldn’t be able to have children. It was an old story that humans and aliens were able to breed, that wasn’t going to happen in the real world. She remembered that much from biology. They talked about inter-species mating and how it was nearly impossible for it to happen since there weren’t any matching… parts. There was no way that it was going to work. And also, the professor did add at the end, if you did that, it would be unnatural. There was an implication that it was a forbidden thing. That if you somehow tried, you would be shunned from society. This was the crystallization of things that she heard all of her life: aliens were not people. that was something that never sat well with her, and she was going to figure out why it did. That was what she said to herself then. Now, she understood why. Because she was destined to fall in love with an alien. Not just any alien. To Nall.</p><hr /><p>So, how do they get magical space rockets into space? Well, first we have to talk about when they figured out how to mix magic and rocketry. The problems in rocketry were numerous, and magic was used to fix each and every problem, one at a time, and with a lot of testing. the majority of empirical data that we have on magic can be traced back to the efforts of space agencies and mages to understand the spells that they used and how exactly they work. For example, one trick that they experimented with was making the inside of the ships larger that the outside of the ships. This principal was originally used to increase the amount of fuel a ship could store while still remaining aerodynamic. They found that with enough fuel, they could fly for long periods of time without refueling. Then they figured out that the fuel itself was a problem. They worked on additives, replacement fuels, but finally, they realized that liquid hydrogen could be infused with an empowerment spell that would increase its reactivity 20 fold. And that was the birth of space fuel, the kind of fuel that we use today in our ships. little has changed about the fuel that we use, and Harriet are you paying attention?</p><p>No, professor, no, I wasn’t. I’m so sorry to have not been paying attention.</p><p>Wow, the truth from you this time, I’m impressed. Please, pay attention in the future? Right, now we have the fuel problem that was solved, but then the gravity problem was the next thing on the checklist, and when they discovered magical gravity flooring, they were able to build cruise liners into space. It really was those three issues, but the final one was the hardest and the most transformative. At least, that is my humble opinion. Now, class, please reach into your folders for your partnered assignment and let’s find out with whom you will be working</p><p>Then, after that, all the subsequent improvements and fixes were all built on top of a gravity plate. The basis for space travel as we know it. This is not a controversial opinion, you’ll find that I’m quite in the scientific majority here. Gravity plates, children, gravity plates.</p><p>Now, go on to your next period. I’m tired of teaching now. He gave a little smile.</p><hr /><p>Fight the Grey Mawt was an old war cry of the Rebellion. They were protecting a convoy when an Imperial ship, the Grey Mawt, interrupted the voyage and destroyed half the cargo ships. This was fairly early in the Rebellion’s history, before they figured out how to survive against the Imperial forces against them, but before their major victory that marked the peak of their resistance. I would name the ships right now, I’m not sure if I have in fact named everything properly, or even getting the history right. The point is that there was an early period, the peak, and then a decline of their power. And it isn’t until they destroy the space station that they start to climb and gain more ground. That’s how the story ends, or at least, how this part of the story ends, when the station is destroyed and the galaxy is safe from a superweapon.</p><p>Fight the Grey Mawt, because that was what you had to do to survive that convoy mission. The Grey Mawt was firing on all ships that were trying to escape its fleet of fighters. They were surrounded by their own convoy in one direction and the Grey Mawt in the other. This was before they knew about positioning about tactics. Honestly, what really saved them is when some imperial military officers defected that they started to become more effective in combat. and that was a strange time, because some of the generals that defected would not willingly fight the enemy, because they were trying to prevent deaths, and so on. Well, they were wrong. The Empire must fall, it is the only way to stop the killings, and the permanent jailing of political prisoners. There was no way that you can have a good society based on that kind of brutality. They were really enjoying themselves, weren’t they, the officers that acted out these orders. Anyone who had a conscience was doomed from the start. This Empress was bad for everyone. She needed to be removed from office, and other such arguments were had ll the time by the generals. Eventually, they typically saw the point of view of the Rebellion and decided to fight. The others, well, they retired from the military and did other things with their time. Like cry into their beer from missing home and making a mistake.</p></div><div class="metadata"><div class="date" title="Zettel date"><time datetime="2020-11-24T21:30">2020-11-24</time></div></div></article><nav class="ui attached segment deemphasized bottomPane"><div><span class="ui basic label zettel-tag" title="Tag">scene/07</span></div></nav><div class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu black"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="right item" href="impulse.html" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></div></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.20.0" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
