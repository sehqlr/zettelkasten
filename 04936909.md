# Beasts

One thing about both star wars and harry potter is the beasts. Both
worlds have them. The ones from star wars are more obviously monsters
that don’t need any context, whereas the beasts from Harry Potter are
taken from folklore. I think maybe a combination of that would serve
this story well. Space monsters, some of which have a greater folklore
connotation. Alien folklore, that is an interesting topic, you can
basically make anything up and bam, it’s mythical .
