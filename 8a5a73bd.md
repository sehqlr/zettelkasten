# Monday 30 Dec 2019

It was a terrible morning for Arthur Blintz, the accountant of the gods.
Actually, it had been a terrible eon, but this particular moment in time
was by far the worst. It was peak misery for a professional working with
immature beings.

The world was new, and it had to be organized, dammit.
