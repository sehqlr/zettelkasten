# Home Improvement Log

These are all the things that Iâ€™ve done around the house successfully

-   Crafted a wooden stand for my stepdaughter's bed frame (long story)
-   Installed a toilet during the first half of November 2020
-   Installed a gas oven just before Thanksgiving, including cobbling
    together a part to make the new gas hose connect to the manual
    shutoff valve.

## Why?

I feel like a fool oftentimes when I am doing home improvement. This log
is here to remind me that I can do things.
